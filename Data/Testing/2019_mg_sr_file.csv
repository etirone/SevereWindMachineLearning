There were two rounds of weather that occurred across Southeast Michigan, the first round of severe weather raced northeast across the area as storms traveled at 100 mph!  The second round of severe weather, which is what brought the tornadoes to the area, was a line of thunderstorms that moved northeast just ahead of a cold front.  As this line moved across the area, there were multiple areas of circulation embedded with the line which resulted in four tornado touchdowns across Shiawassee and Genesee counties.  Three out of the four tornadoes were weak and rated an EF-0.  The tornado that hit near Vernon, MI, was rated an EF-2.  Some debris (insulation/lighter metal) from the M-71 area in Vernon was carried 7 miles by the tornado. The Shiawassee Emergency Manager reported 135 structures, 94 homes, 4 businesses, 16 barns and 22 RVs were damaged or destroyed in the wake of the storms."

Initially, cells over the Southern Tier had trouble building due to the presence of a weak cap. Scattered storms over Allegany County finally broke that cap. Meanwhile, a strong lake breeze shielded the Niagara Frontier. A solid line of strong convection over southern Ontario approached the western edge of the lake breeze late in the afternoon. It was initially believed that the line would weaken as it tried to cross into the marine stabilized air. While the convection itself did weaken, a strong outflow pushed southeast across Niagara county. A warning was in place for the strong winds, and strong gusts did materialize in Niagara Falls.

In its wake, dewpoints jumped into the mid 60s while increasing amounts of sun allowed for a rapid increase in instability over the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes region. While the airmass destabilized, a low-level jet made its way across western New York. This supported ample deep layer shear. Initially, cells over the Southern Tier had trouble building due to the presence of a weak cap. Scattered storms over Allegany County finally broke that cap. Meanwhile, a strong lake breeze shielded the Niagara Frontier. A solid line of strong convection over southern Ontario approached the western edge of the lake breeze late in the afternoon. It was initially believed that the line would weaken as it tried to cross into the marine stabilized air. While the convection itself did weaken, a strong outflow pushed southeast across Niagara county. A warning was in place for the strong winds, and strong gusts did materialize in Niagara Falls. Additional cells formed in the still very unstable air mass over the Southern Tier while the southern Ontario convection broke down. As the evening wore on, the outflow from the southern Ontario convection merged with the eastern edge of the old lake breeze boundary, and a new line blew up east of Batavia and Warsaw. This line eventually supported warnings for the remainder of the area."

While most of this activity was sub-severe, producing only small hail and/or wind gusts up to around 50 MPH, a notable exception occurred in several southwestern counties where a briefly-supercellular storm produced a flurry of severe-criteria wind gusts primarily between 8-9 p.m. CDT. These severe winds of mainly 60-70 MPH concentrated within northern Furnas, southern Gosper, northwestern Harlan and southern Phelps counties, including an intense (albeit unofficial) gust of 86 MPH clocked by a personal weather station north-northwest of Oxford. While ground-truth damage reports were limited, they included: 1) a power pole blown onto Highway 6/34 in Arapahoe along with several large tree limbs down around town...2) various reports of mainly minor damage in/near Holdrege, including: damaged power poles, a large tree down at the cemetery, and part of an irrigation pivot blown onto a rural road a few miles west of town. As this storm of the day progressed into eastern Phelps County it weakened while transitioning to more of a multicell cluster mode. However, storm intensity occasionally flared up farther east, as evidenced by estimated 55-60 MPH winds in southeast Adams County. Lightning also made the news during the evening, as a bolt from a non-severe storm in Grand Island blew out a roughly 5-by-5 foot section from the roof of a retail store, sparking a small fire. Somewhat surprisingly, there was no verified severe-criteria hail during this event, with the largest reported stones only nickel size.||Timing-wise, the first severe storms of the day in close proximity to (but slightly west of) South Central Nebraska erupted along a well-defined cold front in west-central Nebraska during the mid-afternoon. A few hours later, the first strong storm to affect the local area entered western Dawson County between 6-7 p.m. CDT, followed a bit later by the main, outflow-dominant severe cell that rapidly intensified over Gosper/northern Furnas counties. As the night wore on a few larger-scale, predominantly sub-severe storm complexes traversed much of the 30-county area, with most places eventually rain-free by 4-5 a.m. CDT on the 9th. Meteorologically, this was a fairly strongly-forced event. In the mid-upper levels, west-southwesterly flow was present, slightly downstream from a seasonably-strong, large-scale trough traversing the Northern Rockies. At the surface, the aforementioned, northeast-southwest oriented cold front gradually made its way through South Central Nebraska during the evening and overnight hours. Ahead of this boundary, the mesoscale environment was clearly supportive of severe storms, with early-evening parameters featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear. As a testament to the strength of the passing cold front, high temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska dropped from the mid-80s F on the 8th to only the upper-60s on the 9th."

Things started out with a smattering of large hail reports before transitioning to mainly a heavy rain and relatively minor flash flooding event, particularly within western Nuckolls and far eastern Webster counties where rain totals of 2-4 inches were common, and highlighted by 4.72 per an unofficial mesonet west-southwest of Nelson. As for hail, the largest reported stones up to golf ball size occurred in McCool Junction and southeast of Sutton. Severe-criteria wind reports were quite limited, but a mesonet southwest of Nelson gusted to 64 MPH and a completely separate batch of storms farther west yielded a 63 MPH mesonet gust near Cambridge. The most impactful flooding report involved a multiple-hour closure of Highway 136 in far western Nuckolls County due to water over the road. In addition, runoff from heavy rain promoted minor flooding along the Republican River in southern Nuckolls County, with the automated gauge near Hardy cresting at 11.66 ft. during the very early morning hours of Sunday the 16th (flood stage 11.0 ft.).||Breaking down event evolution, severe storms initially got underway between 8-10 p.m. CDT as a cluster of semi-discrete cells erupted within Clay, Fillmore and southern York counties, yielding the majority of the evening's hail reports. Then between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT and slightly to the southwest of the initial storms, additional severe convection and flooding rains blossomed over Nuckolls and eastern Webster counties. After midnight, the most intense storms gradually weakened and/or slipped south of the state line into Kansas, although weaker activity lingered a few more hours before ending altogether. Completely separate from (and several counties to the west of) the severe convection in southeastern counties, a small cluster of storms entered Furnas County from the west shortly before midnight CDT, generating the aforementioned severe gust near Cambridge before quickly weakening. Turning to the meteorological setup, a broad quasi-zonal flow regime was present in the mid-upper levels, featuring passing low-amplitude disturbances. At the surface, the initial evening development seemed to concentrate along a subtle, west-east front, in a mesoscale environment featuring a relatively potent combination of 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear. In addition, convection was aided by warm air/moisture advection along the northwestern fringes of a nocturnal low level jet primarily aligned from southern Kansas into Missouri."

However, as this convective complex first entered the local area into Furnas County it yielded a few severe wind reports, including estimated gusts of 70 MPH in Edison and a measured 67 MPH gust north of Oxford. The origins of this linear system could be traced back to northeast Colorado during the mid-late afternoon, before it grew upscale and intensified over northwest Kansas and southwest Nebraska during the early evening. In the mid-upper levels this was a weakly-forced event, with only subtle disturbances passing through quasi-zonal flow over the Central Plains, downstream from a slow-moving upper low over the Desert Southwest. Given that evening surface dewpoints averaged in the mid-60s F over South Central Nebraska, mixed layer CAPE as high as 2000 J/kg was noted around the time storms entered western counties.

Examining Round 1 in more detail, it unfolded from 4-8 p.m. CDT within several counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 183, but with the majority of action focused within Adams, Webster and Nuckolls counties. The primary player here was an initially isolated, high-precipitation supercell that developed over western Adams County, gradually growing upscale into more of a supercell cluster as it surged southeastward before departing into northern Kansas. This storm was a prolific hail-producer, particularly within southwestern Adams County where there were numerous reports of stones ranging from quarter to larger than baseball size. The area in and near Holstein was particularly hard-hit, as hail as large as 3 was documented there by an NWS employee (although the vast majority of stones were smaller than this). As this massive storm sank farther south it became increasingly outflow-dominant and more of a wind-producer, with several gusts of 55-70 MPH reported in the Guide Rock and Superior areas. Independent of this storm of the day, other severe storms flared up during the afternoon and early evening within counties such as Clay/Fillmore/Franklin, producing hail of 2 diameter near Ong and golf ball size in Naponee. Rainfall-wise, though not extreme, amounts of 1.50-2.50 fell within much of Adams/Webster counties. This led to minor flooding on the Little Blue River, with the gauge near Deweese cresting at 10.3 feet on the afternoon of the 26th (flood stage 10 ft.). ||After Round 1 departed into Kansas, all was quiet on the local front for several hours. However, Round 2 got underway after 1 a.m. CDT on the 26th and persisted until past sunrise. This round of convection was not as intense, mainly producing heavy rainfall, sub-severe wind gusts and small hail within northeastern portions of the area (mainly northeast of an Ord-York line). However, there were a few severe-criteria reports including quarter size hail in York and a 61 MPH wind gust near Waco. Technically, Round 2 consisted of a few separate areas of storms: one small cluster that blew up over York County along the nose of a nocturnal low level jet and another larger complex that expanded across several northeastern counties between 3-7 a.m. CDT before finally weakening and departing the vast majority of South Central Nebraska by 9 a.m. CDT. Rainfall totals of 1.50-3.00 were fairly common with this early-AM activity, highlighted by NeRAIN totals of 3.60 near York and 3.33 north of Osceola.

However, the intense afternoon-early evening convection was clearly tied to low-level convergence along a west-east oriented, quasi-stationary surface front. As afternoon temperatures climbed into the upper 80s F, the mesoscale environment became quite supportive of severe storms (including supercells), featuring 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear. Later in the night, Round 2 was fueled by a classic increase in convergence/moisture transport within the exit region of a 30-40 knot southwesterly low-level jet."

In most places these storms were at least slightly sub-severe, featuring peak wind gusts only 40-50 MPH. However, as this convective complex first entered the local area into Furnas County it yielded a few severe wind reports, including estimated gusts of 70 MPH in Edison and a measured 67 MPH gust north of Oxford. The origins of this linear system could be traced back to northeast Colorado during the mid-late afternoon, before it grew upscale and intensified over northwest Kansas and southwest Nebraska during the early evening. In the mid-upper levels this was a weakly-forced event, with only subtle disturbances passing through quasi-zonal flow over the Central Plains, downstream from a slow-moving upper low over the Desert Southwest. Given that evening surface dewpoints averaged in the mid-60s F over South Central Nebraska, mixed layer CAPE as high as 2000 J/kg was noted around the time storms entered western counties. However, deep-layer wind shear was fairly weak (no more than 30 knots), likely driving the predominantly sub-severe nature of this convection."

While the vast majority of this activity was sub-severe, one storm produced a marginally-severe, localized downburst as it began to collapse in the immediate vicinity of Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island. Shortly before 6:30 p.m. CDT, the airport ASOS clocked a peak easterly gust of 58 MPH, strong enough to blow down at least one tree at nearby Jackrabbit Run Golf Course. Within just a few minutes of producing these strong winds, the storm weakened and soon faded from radar. Interestingly, this storm (and all others in the local area) exhibited a somewhat-unusual southwestward motion due to northeasterly flow through the low-mid levels, largely in response to a shortwave trough drifting from New Mexico into west Texas. At first glance, the mesoscale environment seemed rather unsupportive of severe weather, especially given the presence of weak mid-level lapse rates and very weak deep-layer wind shear. However, due in part to steep low-level lapse rates, mixed-layer CAPE climbed to around 1000 J/kg with a healthy downdraft CAPE component. This potential for strong downdrafts could also be inferred by a fairly large difference between surface temperatures/dewpoints, with the 6 p.m. CDT observation at Grand Island featuring a 26-degree (F) spread of 87/61."

Examining Round 1 in more detail, it unfolded from 4-8 p.m. CDT within several counties south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 183, but with the majority of action focused within Adams, Webster and Nuckolls counties. The primary player here was an initially isolated, high-precipitation supercell that developed over western Adams County, gradually growing upscale into more of a supercell cluster as it surged southeastward before departing into northern Kansas. This storm was a prolific hail-producer, particularly within southwestern Adams County where there were numerous reports of stones ranging from quarter to larger than baseball size. The area in and near Holstein was particularly hard-hit, as hail as large as 3 was documented there by an NWS employee (although the vast majority of stones were smaller than this). As this massive storm sank farther south it became increasingly outflow-dominant and more of a wind-producer, with several gusts of 55-70 MPH reported in the Guide Rock and Superior areas. Independent of this storm of the day, other severe storms flared up during the afternoon and early evening within counties such as Clay/Fillmore/Franklin, producing hail of 2 diameter near Ong and golf ball size in Naponee. Rainfall-wise, though not extreme, amounts of 1.50-2.50 fell within much of Adams/Webster counties. This led to minor flooding on the Little Blue River, with the gauge near Deweese cresting at 10.3 feet on the afternoon of the 26th (flood stage 10 ft.). ||After Round 1 departed into Kansas, all was quiet on the local front for several hours. However, Round 2 got underway after 1 a.m. CDT on the 26th and persisted until past sunrise. This round of convection was not as intense, mainly producing heavy rainfall, sub-severe wind gusts and small hail within northeastern portions of the area (mainly northeast of an Ord-York line). However, there were a few severe-criteria reports including quarter size hail in York and a 61 MPH wind gust near Waco. Technically, Round 2 consisted of a few separate areas of storms: one small cluster that blew up over York County along the nose of a nocturnal low level jet and another larger complex that expanded across several northeastern counties between 3-7 a.m. CDT before finally weakening and departing the vast majority of South Central Nebraska by 9 a.m. CDT.

Things started out with a smattering of large hail reports before transitioning to mainly a heavy rain and relatively minor flash flooding event, particularly within western Nuckolls and far eastern Webster counties where rain totals of 2-4 inches were common, and highlighted by 4.72 per an unofficial mesonet west-southwest of Nelson. As for hail, the largest reported stones up to golf ball size occurred in McCool Junction and southeast of Sutton. Severe-criteria wind reports were quite limited, but a mesonet southwest of Nelson gusted to 64 MPH and a completely separate batch of storms farther west yielded a 63 MPH mesonet gust near Cambridge. The most impactful flooding report involved a multiple-hour closure of Highway 136 in far western Nuckolls County due to water over the road. In addition, runoff from heavy rain promoted minor flooding along the Republican River in southern Nuckolls County, with the automated gauge near Hardy cresting at 11.66 ft. during the very early morning hours of Sunday the 16th (flood stage 11.0 ft.).||Breaking down event evolution, severe storms initially got underway between 8-10 p.m. CDT as a cluster of semi-discrete cells erupted within Clay, Fillmore and southern York counties, yielding the majority of the evening's hail reports. Then between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT and slightly to the southwest of the initial storms, additional severe convection and flooding rains blossomed over Nuckolls and eastern Webster counties. After midnight, the most intense storms gradually weakened and/or slipped south of the state line into Kansas, although weaker activity lingered a few more hours before ending altogether. Completely separate from (and several counties to the west of) the severe convection in southeastern counties, a small cluster of storms entered Furnas County from the west shortly before midnight CDT, generating the aforementioned severe gust near Cambridge before quickly weakening. Turning to the meteorological setup, a broad quasi-zonal flow regime was present in the mid-upper levels, featuring passing low-amplitude disturbances. At the surface, the initial evening development seemed to concentrate along a subtle, west-east front, in a mesoscale environment featuring a relatively potent combination of 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear.

Ord airport clocked a peak gust of 74 MPH, and in town there were reports of several damaged trees and a few downed power lines. A bit later and one county to the east, an NeRAIN observer in Spalding noted trees down around town. This small storm complex initiated over the far northern Nebraska Panhandle during the early evening, before steadily tracking east-southeast and eventually infiltrating  the local area. This was a sneaky severe weather event, mainly given that radar signatures were not very suggestive of intense outflow winds, due in part to shallow storm cores (especially by June standards). In addition, instability was seemingly limited, with most-unstable CAPE only analyzed around 500 J/kg. However, other factors were more favorable for storm organization and sustenance, including steep mid-level lapse rates and the presence of a low amplitude disturbance embedded within fairly strong west-northwest flow aloft."

First, between midnight and 1:30 a.m. CDT, an isolated storm with radar-indicated hail potential (but no verifying reports) tracked across far southern Rooks and southwestern Osborne counties before dissipating. Then, later in the night/early morning (mainly 3-6 a.m. CDT), a complex of storms roamed through much of the area from southwest-to-northeast. While the vast majority of this activity was sub-severe, a mesonet in southern Mitchell County clocked a 61 MPH gust. Finally, following a lull in storm activity through most of the day, the left-split of a cluster of strong to severe storms that initiated over central Kansas wandered northward through eastern Mitchell and southeastern Jewell counties between 5-7 p.m. CDT, producing nickel to quarter size hail in Beloit. In the mid-upper levels, an active weather pattern for the Central Plains was firmly in place on the 22nd, featuring seasonably-strong southwesterly flow, downstream from a large-scale trough centered over the Central and Northern Rockies. At the surface, the local area resided along a north-south oriented quasi-stationary front, serving as a dividing line between a humid and very unstable airmass over much of the eastern half of Kansas and a drier airmass in the western half of the Sunflower State. As evidence of this boundary, at 4 p.m. CDT, surface dewpoints near the local area ranged from 56 F at Hill City to 70 F at Concordia."

The culprits were two separate linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS), with the first one by far the most impactful. This first storm complex, which traversed the area between 10:30 p.m. and 3 a.m. CDT, produced a swath of damaging winds ranging anywhere from 60 up to around 90 MPH, particularly within a corridor centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Cambridge-Minden-Hastings-Sutton. Within this area, there were countless reports of damage, particularly to the likes of trees (many large trees uprooted), power poles/lines and irrigation pivots, but also to some structures (mainly rural outbuildings). A short list of some of the hardest-hit communities included: Arapahoe, Oxford, Kenesaw and Hastings, with Hastings likely enduring its most widespread tree damage in roughly five years. As just a few specific instances of damage and/or measured winds: a grain bin and outbuilding were destroyed near Holbrook with irrigation pipe blown up to one-half mile; an unofficial mesonet gusted to 95 MPH near Oxford; several farm outbuildings were damaged/destroyed near Phillips with sheet metal hanging in trees.

At the surface, South Central Nebraska resided just north of a west-east oriented front stretched near the Kansas border. As a low-amplitude disturbance entered southern Nebraska during the evening, this forcing combined with a very unstable airmass and increasing moisture convergence within the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet to spark the MCS activity. By late-night standards, it was a fairly volatile mesoscale environment, featuring 2000-4000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

The culprits were two separate linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS), with the first one by far the most impactful. This first storm complex, which traversed the area between 10:30 p.m. and 3 a.m. CDT, produced a swath of damaging winds ranging anywhere from 60 up to around 90 MPH, particularly within a corridor centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Cambridge-Minden-Hastings-Sutton. Within this area, there were countless reports of damage, particularly to the likes of trees (many large trees uprooted), power poles/lines and irrigation pivots, but also to some structures (mainly rural outbuildings). A short list of some of the hardest-hit communities included: Arapahoe, Oxford, Kenesaw and Hastings, with Hastings likely enduring its most widespread tree damage in roughly five years. As just a few specific instances of damage and/or measured winds: a grain bin and outbuilding were destroyed near Holbrook with irrigation pipe blown up to one-half mile; an unofficial mesonet gusted to 95 MPH near Oxford; several farm outbuildings were damaged/destroyed near Phillips with sheet metal hanging in trees. Within the Tri Cities, Hastings clearly bore the brunt of wind issues, as Grand Island and Kearney only received a glancing blow of sub-severe gusts mainly in the 40-55 MPH range. However, some places outside of the main damage swath still weren't spared from storm impacts, including in Farwell, where a lightning-induced fire damaged a portion of the fire hall. This primary linear MCS exhibited impressive radar signatures including a bookend vortex and rear inflow notch, with the system as a whole taking on a notable S-shape on reflectivity. As the initial MCS began departing the local area into eastern Nebraska, a second round of storms got underway back to the west, in response to lift above the residual cold pool. Although not nearly as intense/organized as the earlier system, this convection congealed into a northeast-southwest oriented MCS as it entered southwestern counties such as Furnas/Gosper/Harlan between 3:30-4:30 a.m. CDT. For a while, this second system remained slightly sub-severe, with peak gusts only to around 50 MPH (including 53 MPH at Hastings airport).

These storms generally remained sub-severe, but a brief EF-0 tornado occurred in Superior at 945 PM CST. The storms had congealed and become quasi-linear, but the low-level and deep-layer shear and SRH were very high, resulting in a shear-dominant line with the most intense cores at the back edge of the line. Along the updraft-downdraft convergence zone, a very small, brief mesovortex formed and produced the tornado. This occurred within a developing bookend vortex, just north of the rear-inflow notch. The one storm that moved different from all the others was a left-moving supercell that originated from a cell split over Rooks county Kansas. That storm moved due north from Alma to Kearney to Loup City from 8 to 945 PM CST, producing quarter size hail in Wilcox and 1 to 2 inch hail in Kearney. Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms were on-going over southwest Nebraska. These storms entered western Dawson county around 10 PM CST, and during the following two hours these storms organized into a squall line that extended from Ord to Loup City to Lexington to near McCook by 12 AM CST. These storms produced golf ball size hail in and east of Gothenburg, and measured winds of 58 MPH at Cozad. Quarter size hail also occurred in Miller and Ravenna. This line broken into two separate lines, one of which moved east between Interstate 80 and Highway 6, and the other north of the Interstate. The storms remained sub-severe, but a wind gust of 55 MPH was measured at the Hastings airport, and nickel size hail occurred in York. A third cluster of scattered storms developed over southwest Nebraska around midnight. These storms consolidated into a multicell cluster and moved from west to east across the region from 2 to 530 AM CST Tuesday the 28th. These storms were not severe, but they added to the rainfall totals. Total rainfall amounts from all three thunderstorm episodes were not excessive, but given that 2 to 4 inches fell across a large portion of south central Nebraska just 24 hours before, an additional 1 to 2 inches was not needed. ||Water levels were already rising on area creeks and rivers from the heavy rain Sunday night. Flooding began to occur as an increasing number of creeks and rivers overflowed their banks through the day. Minor flooding began around sunrise Monday on the upper portions of the Little Blue River from southeastern Adams county into northern Nuckolls county. The Republican River at Riverton had also risen above flood stage. Thompson Creek, which also passes through Riverton, rapidly increased to moderate flood stage. Whatever impacts might have occurred were not known. In Polk county, extensive flooding resulted in numerous road closures. Bridges on gravel roads had water flowing over them. Highway 81 between Osceola and Shelby was closed because it was impassable. The emergency manager stated that the flooding was worse than what occurred in March of this year. Throughout the day, extensive flooding developed over more and more low-lying areas, creeks, and rivers in south central Nebraska. Numerous mostly gravel roads were impassable. All of the counties along and south of the Platte River were affected, although the Platte River itself did not flood. As flooding worsened along the Little Blue River, the Crystal Lake State Recreation Area near Ayr had to be evacuated and closed. Highway 5 north of Deshler was closed due to the Little Blue River. U.S. Highway 6 near Sutton was closed due to floodwater covering the road. The Republican River also went into flood from Guide Rock to Hardy. Across Hamilton, York, and Polk counties, the West Fork of the Big Blue River, the Big Blue River, Lincoln Creek, and Beaver Creek all flooded. In Merrick county, extensive flooding occurred due to Prairie and Silver Creeks. In Dawson and Buffalo counties, Buffalo and Spring Creeks flooded, as well as Mud Creek near Ravenna. Prairie Dog Creek also flooded southwest of Harlan County Lake. This was the second significant flood to occur since the record and near-record flooding in March 2019.||A quasi-stationary front extended from the Mid-Atlantic across the Midwest to low pressure over Iowa. The front then extended southwest across Nebraska and Kansas to another low over Colorado. In the upper-levels, a longwave trough was over the western U.S., with a fairly flat ridge over the east. An upper low moved from Nevada into Utah through the day with southwest flow over the Central Plains. Just before the storms moved into south central Nebraska, temperatures were in the 70s, with dewpoints in the 60s. Despite low mid-level lapse rates, MUCAPE was between 2000 and 3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was very strong (60-70 kt), with 0-3 km SRH 250-500 m2/s2, with the highest values on the cool side of the front, where low-level winds were most-backed. The persistence of the atmosphere to initiate multiple thunderstorm episodes was impressive, but even more impressive was that they each moved downstream over the same area, between the surface and 850 mb fronts. The initial storms clearly did not exhaust the instability. Through the night, the low over Colorado moved into western Kansas. This maintained the low-level jet, which terminated at the 850 mb front. The low-level jet did not move. The 850 mb front remained stalled near the Kansas-Nebraska border, along with the terminus of maximum 850 mb moisture transport and the 850 mb theta-e ridge."

Around 2 PM CST, a thunderstorm initiated over Merrick county and quickly became supercellular. This storm moved due south across Hamilton county from 3 PM to 5 PM CST, producing lots of severe hail the entire way. The ground was covered white in some locations. The hail was mostly between the size of quarters and golf balls, until the storm moved south of Interstate 80. Between the Interstate and Stockham, tennis ball to baseball size hail occurred. A severe wind gust of 58 mph was measured at the Aurora airport while the storm was moving through town. A funnel cloud was also reported just west of town as well. This storm moved into Clay county after 5 PM CST. Other storms formed to its west over Adams county, creating an east-west oriented line of multicell storms. All of these storms continued to produce hail up to the size of golf balls. While this was on-going, another severe thunderstorm formed over Norton county Kansas and moved east-northeast across Harlan and Franklin counties. This storm also produced severe hail up to 2 inches in diameter before it merged with the storms over Adams and Clay counties around 630 PM CST. The combined multicell complex produced a couple more reports of severe hail over northern Webster county before weakening and shifting direction to the southeast.||1004 mb low pressure was over Ontario, Canada. Its associated cold front was slowly sagging south through Nebraska and was largely oriented east-west. A 1005 mb low was along the front near McCook with the dryline extending southwest from this low. In the upper-levels, fairly weak zonal flow was over the U.S., with a broad trof from central Canada into the north-central United States. Temperatures in the preconvective environment were in the upper 70s, with dewpoints in the lower to middle 50s. However, steep mid-level lapse rates of 8 C/km and the associated cold upper troposphere resulted in MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg. 0-6 km shear was around 35 kt. The freezing level was relatively low (around 9800 ft AGL) creating a very favorable environment for lots of hail. SRH was highest immediately behind the front, where surface winds became northeast. It appears the Merrick-Hamilton-Clay county storm may have been along and possibly just behind the front. One thing is for sure, the SRH was greater than what mesoanalysis indicated as it was based on an expected storm motion from the northwest at 10-15 kt. However, actual storm motion was due south."

The culprits were two separate linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS), with the first one by far the most impactful. This first storm complex, which traversed the area between 10:30 p.m. and 3 a.m. CDT, produced a swath of damaging winds ranging anywhere from 60 up to around 90 MPH, particularly within a corridor centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Cambridge-Minden-Hastings-Sutton. Within this area, there were countless reports of damage, particularly to the likes of trees (many large trees uprooted), power poles/lines and irrigation pivots, but also to some structures (mainly rural outbuildings). A short list of some of the hardest-hit communities included: Arapahoe, Oxford, Kenesaw and Hastings, with Hastings likely enduring its most widespread tree damage in roughly five years. As just a few specific instances of damage and/or measured winds: a grain bin and outbuilding were destroyed near Holbrook with irrigation pipe blown up to one-half mile; an unofficial mesonet gusted to 95 MPH near Oxford; several farm outbuildings were damaged/destroyed near Phillips with sheet metal hanging in trees. Within the Tri Cities, Hastings clearly bore the brunt of wind issues, as Grand Island and Kearney only received a glancing blow of sub-severe gusts mainly in the 40-55 MPH range. However, some places outside of the main damage swath still weren't spared from storm impacts, including in Farwell, where a lightning-induced fire damaged a portion of the fire hall. This primary linear MCS exhibited impressive radar signatures including a bookend vortex and rear inflow notch, with the system as a whole taking on a notable S-shape on reflectivity. As the initial MCS began departing the local area into eastern Nebraska, a second round of storms got underway back to the west, in response to lift above the residual cold pool. Although not nearly as intense/organized as the earlier system, this convection congealed into a northeast-southwest oriented MCS as it entered southwestern counties such as Furnas/Gosper/Harlan between 3:30-4:30 a.m. CDT. For a while, this second system remained slightly sub-severe, with peak gusts only to around 50 MPH (including 53 MPH at Hastings airport). However, some intensification to marginally-severe levels occurred between 5:30-6:30 a.m. CDT in far southeast counties, evidenced by mesonet wind gusts of 67 MPH near Superior and 60 MPH at Davenport. The back edge of this second MCS departed the local area out of Thayer County by 7 a.m. CDT, finally ending the rocky night. ||Interestingly, severe-criteria hail was very limited during this event, taking a clear backseat to damaging winds. However, a few quarter size stones were reported in and near communities such as Cambridge and Nelson. The Cambridge area was likely the hardest-hit, as copious amounts of mainly small hail combined with winds to promote fairly extensive crop damage. Rainfall-wise, the majority of South Central Nebraska measured between 0.50-1.50, holding flooding issues at bay. However, there were limited corridors of 2-3+, particularly within parts of Furnas/Gosper/Phelps counties. Including more rain that fell on the morning of the 22nd, Thayer County actually dealt with some of the worst flooding issues in the ensuing few days, such as water over several rural roads and a bridge washout north of Chester. ||Looking at the meteorological setup, this was a fairly classic recipe for intense overnight convection in the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, seasonably-strong, west-southwesterly flow was in place, downstream from a large-scale trough centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, South Central Nebraska resided just north of a west-east oriented front stretched near the Kansas border. As a low-amplitude disturbance entered southern Nebraska during the evening, this forcing combined with a very unstable airmass and increasing moisture convergence within the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet to spark the MCS activity. By late-night standards, it was a fairly volatile mesoscale environment, featuring 2000-4000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

From 5 to 6 PM CST, thunderstorms moving from northwest Kansas into south central Nebraska clipped northern Phillips county. Anvil rain from thunderstorms over central Kansas began spreading into Rooks, Osborne, and Mitchell counties around 5 PM CST as well. This rain overspread all of north central Kansas over the following couple hours. Around 7 PM CST, the back edge of this rain began progressing across Rooks and Osborne counties. As this occurred, a wake low developed producing damaging winds in some locations. Numerous trees limbs were snapped in Plainville and these damaging winds extended all the way to Osborne where trees were damaged there as well. An unofficial home weather station measured a wind gust of 70 MPH in eastern Rooks county. As this rain exited north central Kansas, more scattered thunderstorms developed near Interstate 70 and moved northeast into the area. Just after midnight, a brief EF-0 tornado touched down near Tipton and damaged a residence and some nearby trees and power poles. Shortly thereafter, the same narrow line of storms produced a wind gust of 59 mph at an unofficial station over south central Mitchell county. Meanwhile, a mesoscale convective system had developed over southwest Kansas. The northern portion of this MCS crossed north central Kansas between 11 PM and 2 AM. While no severe storms occurred, more heavy rain fell over northern Phillips county, where heavy rain had occurred from earlier thunderstorms. Repeated episodes of heavy rain resulted in a swath of 2.5 to nearly 5 inches from northwest Kansas into south central Nebraska. This swath of rain clipped northern Phillips county and fell directly along the basin of Prairie Dog Creek. 4.90 inches of rain fell in 12 hours at Long Island.||At sunrise, a stationary front extended from the lower Great Lakes across northern Kansas to low pressure near Pueblo, Colorado. During the afternoon, this front moved into Nebraska as a warm front. The upper-level flow was highly-amplified with a deep trough over the Western U.S., and a subtropical high over Florida. Kansas was just west of a ridge that extended from Arkansas to Montana. Before rain began falling, temperatures were in the 70s with dewpoints in the 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were 7.0-7.5 C/km, resulting in MLCAPE around 2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was initially 30-35 kt, but increased to 60 kt by midnight. MUCAPE was still around 1500 J/kg."

A belt of southwesterly mid- to upper-level winds up to about 50 knots preceded the axis of this trough and contributed to moderate to strong vertical wind shear, which favored the development of organized thunderstorms in the form of multicells and supercells. At the surface, winds exhibited an easterly component at times. These surface winds transported greater low-level moisture into the area from the Dakotas. Farther aloft, southwesterly winds near 10,000 feet MSL were present ahead of the Pacific trough axis and transported abundant amounts of Pacific moisture into the region. The resulting unusually-high humidity and daytime heating contributed to a weak to moderate instability especially over Southwest Montana. Also notable was a pronounced elevated mixed layer (EML), a term for an elevated dry layer of the lower to middle atmosphere, moving north from Utah and eastern Idaho. EMLs are much more common across the Great Plains of the United States and are associated with many of the classic spring severe weather outbreaks in the central part of the county."

This was a high shear, low CAPE environment initially which kept convection to a minimum until around 5 PM when just enough CAPE was there to rapidly increase storm coverage and severity.  LCL heights were around 750m at the time. The shear profile was ideal for creating numerous rotating thunderstorms.  With 0-1km Shear over 30 knots and Storm Relative Helicity in excess of 300 m^2/s^2, the low level environment was primed for tornadoes.  The 0-6km shear of 40-50 knots was sufficient for rotating supercells. The significant tornado parameter was not quite as impressive and was kept fairly low due to the low CAPE environment.  Had CAPE values been closer to 2000-3000 J/kg, a much more intense outbreak would have occurred.

The strongest thunderstorm of the day initially developed in Lamb County and slowly moved northeast into Hale and Swisher Counties. Numerous storm chasers observed this storm and documented several tornadoes during its life cycle. The first tornado was observed approximately five miles southwest of Edmonson in Hale County. However, the NWS storm survey team was unable to locate any damage due to its brief duration and lack of damage indicators. Therefore, an EFU rating was assigned. The next tornado was observed several miles southwest of Tulia in Swisher County. Although this multi vortex tornado persisted for several minutes, no damage indicators were impacted, so an EFU rating was assigned to this tornado as well. The third tornado was observed about 4-5 miles northwest of Vigo Park and was the largest of the three. Similar to the other two tornadoes, no damage indicators were found by the NWS storm survey team, so a rating of EFU was assigned. Extremely strong rear flank downdraft winds were observed with this third tornado west of Vigo Park near the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 146 and 2301. A metal barn was partially destroyed and 19 wood transmission lines were snapped. Due to the slow moving nature of these storms, extremely heavy rainfall occurred in central Swisher County which brought an estimated three to six inches of rainfall over a short period of time.

Farther aloft, southwesterly winds near 10,000 feet MSL were present ahead of the Pacific trough axis and transported abundant amounts of Pacific moisture into the region.

Due to the very open terrain, no damage was reported due to the strong wind gust.","Isolated monsoon thunderstorms developed across the southwestern deserts during the evening hours on September 4th and some of them affected areas to the northeast of Yuma and east of the lower Colorado River valley. The storms produced weather hazards typical of monsoon storms; gusty and damaging outflow winds and locally heavy rainfall. Heavy rains produced an episode of flash flooding; at 2022MST a mesonet gage reported a 9 foot rise in water in an unnamed wash in the Yuma Proving Ground. A bit earlier, at 1912MST, another mesnet gage in the proving ground measured a gust to 68 mph. Additionally, strong winds blew over 7 power poles and bent numerous others in the same proving grounds, about 26 miles northwest of Ligurta. No injuries were reported as a result of the strong winds."

A power line was downed in town due to a broken tree limb.,"Excessive rainfall, flash flooding, and severe winds occurred on this Monday afternoon and evening. Widely scattered thunderstorms began forming around 1 PM CST along and west of Highway 183. By 2 PM CST, a persistent line segment of thunderstorms began affecting western Dawson county. Over the following four hours, this southwest-northeast oriented line slowly crept east across Dawson county into western Buffalo county, with its southwest end moving from Gosper county into Phelps county. A downburst occurred in Cozad where winds were measured at 63 mph. Further east, trees were damaged near Elm Creek. This line of storms subsequently weakened as it moved into eastern Buffalo county. However, between 5 and 9 PM CST, numerous small thunderstorms formed over Gosper, Furnas, Phelps, and Harlan counties. Storms kept forming over these counties until a multi-county area of persistent heavy rain enveloped these counties and expanded north to include Dawson and Buffalo counties. By 9 PM CST, the heaviest rain had morphed to the southeast side of a large, expanding rain shield, with a nearly stationary band stretching from southwest to northeast across Furnas, Phelps, and Buffalo counties. After 10 PM CST, a large squall line that had developed far to the west, over the high plains, began moving into south-central Nebraska. It brought a third period of heavy rain to these counties, but its cold pool aided in shoving the training, slow-moving mass of heavy rain eastward. The two areas of rain merged with a progressive squall line subsequently advancing across the rest of the south central Nebraska. The squall line exited into southeast Nebraska by 230 AM CST. Severe downburst winds occurred a few spots with this squall line. A few tree limbs were snapped off in Oxford and Kearney, and 36 power poles were snapped off over a 2-mile stretch southeast of Holdrege. The highest rainfall total reported was 10.65 inches 3 miles southwest of Odessa. The second highest was 8.88 inches in Loomis. 8.33 fell near Hildreth, 7.66 in Riverdale, 7.60 near Lexington, 6.50 near Cozad, 5.90 near Minden, and 5.64 on the southwest side of Kearney.||Late in the afternoon, a few thunderstorms moved north from Kansas ahead of the storms west of Highway 183. These storms produced some spotty tree damage in Webster and Kearney counties, and damage two livestock sheds in the town of Ayr. A brief rope tornado was also reported near Roseland. ||At the surface, a stalled front extended from the Mid-Atlantic states west to the southern Kansas border. Throughout the day, this front gradually lifted north as a warm front. Meanwhile, low pressure over eastern Colorado moved into northwest Kansas, joining the western end of the front. In the upper-levels weak southwest flow was over Nebraska with a longwave trough advancing eastward through the western U.S., and a ridge over the Upper Midwest. An embedded shortwave trough moved out of Colorado and crossed Nebraska, creating a favorable environment for thunderstorms. As the initial thunderstorms developed, the environment was characterized by surface temperatures in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but despite that, MLCAPE was 2500-3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was weak at less than 20 kt. Precipitable water values were around 1.70 inches, which was close to a record. ||The excessive rainfall resulted in flash flooding in parts of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, and Buffalo counties, including flooding across parts of U.S. Highways 6, 30, 183, and 283. Numerous gravel county roads were inundated by flood waters and impassible. Many of them were severely damaged. Roads in the city of Kearney were flooded from one curb to the other, and in at least two separate places, water was 3 to 4 ft deep. Almost 40 vehicles were stranded in Kearney streets. Basements were flooded in some homes due to egress windows breaking. The student union was flooded on the University of Nebraska campus in Kearney. Two to three feet of water was reported in the lower level of the food court. In Lexington, cars were stalled in flood waters and 23 people were evacuated from an apartment building due to flooding. The Red Cross opened a shelter to care for those evacuated.||In some areas, the impacts worsened the following day as creeks swelled out of their banks. Gibbon, Kearney, Odessa, Elm Creek, and Lexington were all severely impacted. U.S. highway 30 was closed due to floodwater from Shelton to Kearney to Elm Creek, as well as near Lexington. Turkey Creek drains into the North Channel of the Platte River, which runs through the south side of Kearney. Water rapidly rose on the south side of the city Tuesday morning, inundating numerous hotels, restaurants, businesses, and basements. At least 200 people had to be evacuated from hotels using construction grade front-end loaders. Approximately 100 other nearby residents needed to be evacuated as well. At its peak, water was 2 to 4 feet high inside the hotels, and 4 to 5 feet high in the parking lots. The water rose so quickly that many people staying at the hotels did not have time to move their vehicles. Most vehicles at the hotels were a total loss. Hundreds of vehicles in the city had to be towed. Some businesses were closed for weeks, others for months, as repairs and remodeling were completed. Kitchen equipment was ruined at some restaurants. Of the 1800 hotels rooms in Kearney, only about 600 were available for use because first floor services, such as check-in desks, laundry facilities, and kitchens were damaged. Stagecoach souvenir shop lost 2,000 pounds of merchandise. Second avenue, which is the main north-south thoroughfare through the city, was closed from Interstate 80 to 11th avenue. The Interstate 80 off ramp was also closed. All traffic to and from the Interstate, from the city, had to use the Kearney East Expressway. Approximately 400 Kearney homes were damaged by the flood, and many more beyond city limits. Just as one example, an egress window gave way in a home on the southeast side of Kearney. Water rushed into the basement, filling it nearly to the ceiling. Extensive flooding resulted in the closure of Yanney Park. A power substation flooded and resulted in power outages to about 450 customers. Flood waters began to subside Wednesday, July 10th, which allowed for one lane of 2nd avenue to be reopened in each direction.||In Odessa, flooding was significant. Water was 4 feet deep on Webb street. A little further south, the Odessa exit from Interstate 80 was closed because of significant flooding. Water was about 3 feet deep at the truck stop adjacent to the Interstate. Semi trucks and cars pulled into the truck stop due to the heavy rain Monday evening, but by 630 AM CST Tuesday, water was up to the top of the wheel wells on several semi's. Flooded vehicles had to be towed. The Platte River, which is very wide and shallow, rose 3 feet in 12 hours from 6 PM CST Monday to 6 AM CST Tuesday, and 4 feet in 24 hours. It is very difficult for the Platte River to flood, but it crested at 8.3 feet at 515 PM CST Tuesday. Flood stage is 7 feet.||In the town of Elm Creek, many roads and basements were flooded. A gauge on Elm Creek indicated that the water level rose 8 feet in 2 hours Monday evening.||The city of Lexington issued a disaster declaration due to the disruption of utility services. Streets and homes were flooded with sewers backing up into homes. ||Flooding was extensive along the Wood River. Moderate flooding occurred at Riverdale with water covering the bridge just north of town. Further to the north, flooding forced the closure of state highway 10 between Pleasanton and Hazard.||In Gibbon, water flooded streets and basements for the second time this year. The northeast side of town was impacted the worst with at least 30 homes and several businesses inundated by floodwater. People had to sandbag their homes and businesses. It is believed that flooding on the Wood River was wider with this event, due to changes in the riverbed from the prior flood in March. Some places that did not flood in that event, flooded this time. Many people commented, I can't believe this has happened twice. Several businesses affected by the March flood still remained closed due to damage.||Amtrak trains that travel between Chicago and Emeryville, CA were halted in Lincoln and McCook due to the flooding.

Widely scattered thunderstorms began forming around 1 PM CST along and west of Highway 183. By 2 PM CST, a persistent line segment of thunderstorms began affecting western Dawson county. Over the following four hours, this southwest-northeast oriented line slowly crept east across Dawson county into western Buffalo county, with its southwest end moving from Gosper county into Phelps county. A downburst occurred in Cozad where winds were measured at 63 mph. Further east, trees were damaged near Elm Creek. This line of storms subsequently weakened as it moved into eastern Buffalo county. However, between 5 and 9 PM CST, numerous small thunderstorms formed over Gosper, Furnas, Phelps, and Harlan counties. Storms kept forming over these counties until a multi-county area of persistent heavy rain enveloped these counties and expanded north to include Dawson and Buffalo counties. By 9 PM CST, the heaviest rain had morphed to the southeast side of a large, expanding rain shield, with a nearly stationary band stretching from southwest to northeast across Furnas, Phelps, and Buffalo counties. After 10 PM CST, a large squall line that had developed far to the west, over the high plains, began moving into south-central Nebraska. It brought a third period of heavy rain to these counties, but its cold pool aided in shoving the training, slow-moving mass of heavy rain eastward. The two areas of rain merged with a progressive squall line subsequently advancing across the rest of the south central Nebraska. The squall line exited into southeast Nebraska by 230 AM CST. Severe downburst winds occurred a few spots with this squall line. A few tree limbs were snapped off in Oxford and Kearney, and 36 power poles were snapped off over a 2-mile stretch southeast of Holdrege. The highest rainfall total reported was 10.65 inches 3 miles southwest of Odessa. The second highest was 8.88 inches in Loomis. 8.33 fell near Hildreth, 7.66 in Riverdale, 7.60 near Lexington, 6.50 near Cozad, 5.90 near Minden, and 5.64 on the southwest side of Kearney.||Late in the afternoon, a few thunderstorms moved north from Kansas ahead of the storms west of Highway 183. These storms produced some spotty tree damage in Webster and Kearney counties, and damage two livestock sheds in the town of Ayr. A brief rope tornado was also reported near Roseland. ||At the surface, a stalled front extended from the Mid-Atlantic states west to the southern Kansas border. Throughout the day, this front gradually lifted north as a warm front. Meanwhile, low pressure over eastern Colorado moved into northwest Kansas, joining the western end of the front. In the upper-levels weak southwest flow was over Nebraska with a longwave trough advancing eastward through the western U.S., and a ridge over the Upper Midwest. An embedded shortwave trough moved out of Colorado and crossed Nebraska, creating a favorable environment for thunderstorms. As the initial thunderstorms developed, the environment was characterized by surface temperatures in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but despite that, MLCAPE was 2500-3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was weak at less than 20 kt. Precipitable water values were around 1.70 inches, which was close to a record. ||The excessive rainfall resulted in flash flooding in parts of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, and Buffalo counties, including flooding across parts of U.S. Highways 6, 30, 183, and 283. Numerous gravel county roads were inundated by flood waters and impassible. Many of them were severely damaged. Roads in the city of Kearney were flooded from one curb to the other, and in at least two separate places, water was 3 to 4 ft deep. Almost 40 vehicles were stranded in Kearney streets. Basements were flooded in some homes due to egress windows breaking. The student union was flooded on the University of Nebraska campus in Kearney. Two to three feet of water was reported in the lower level of the food court. In Lexington, cars were stalled in flood waters and 23 people were evacuated from an apartment building due to flooding. The Red Cross opened a shelter to care for those evacuated.||In some areas, the impacts worsened the following day as creeks swelled out of their banks. Gibbon, Kearney, Odessa, Elm Creek, and Lexington were all severely impacted. U.S. highway 30 was closed due to floodwater from Shelton to Kearney to Elm Creek, as well as near Lexington. Turkey Creek drains into the North Channel of the Platte River, which runs through the south side of Kearney. Water rapidly rose on the south side of the city Tuesday morning, inundating numerous hotels, restaurants, businesses, and basements. At least 200 people had to be evacuated from hotels using construction grade front-end loaders. Approximately 100 other nearby residents needed to be evacuated as well. At its peak, water was 2 to 4 feet high inside the hotels, and 4 to 5 feet high in the parking lots. The water rose so quickly that many people staying at the hotels did not have time to move their vehicles. Most vehicles at the hotels were a total loss. Hundreds of vehicles in the city had to be towed. Some businesses were closed for weeks, others for months, as repairs and remodeling were completed. Kitchen equipment was ruined at some restaurants. Of the 1800 hotels rooms in Kearney, only about 600 were available for use because first floor services, such as check-in desks, laundry facilities, and kitchens were damaged. Stagecoach souvenir shop lost 2,000 pounds of merchandise. Second avenue, which is the main north-south thoroughfare through the city, was closed from Interstate 80 to 11th avenue. The Interstate 80 off ramp was also closed. All traffic to and from the Interstate, from the city, had to use the Kearney East Expressway. Approximately 400 Kearney homes were damaged by the flood, and many more beyond city limits. Just as one example, an egress window gave way in a home on the southeast side of Kearney. Water rushed into the basement, filling it nearly to the ceiling. Extensive flooding resulted in the closure of Yanney Park. A power substation flooded and resulted in power outages to about 450 customers. Flood waters began to subside Wednesday, July 10th, which allowed for one lane of 2nd avenue to be reopened in each direction.||In Odessa, flooding was significant. Water was 4 feet deep on Webb street. A little further south, the Odessa exit from Interstate 80 was closed because of significant flooding. Water was about 3 feet deep at the truck stop adjacent to the Interstate. Semi trucks and cars pulled into the truck stop due to the heavy rain Monday evening, but by 630 AM CST Tuesday, water was up to the top of the wheel wells on several semi's. Flooded vehicles had to be towed. The Platte River, which is very wide and shallow, rose 3 feet in 12 hours from 6 PM CST Monday to 6 AM CST Tuesday, and 4 feet in 24 hours. It is very difficult for the Platte River to flood, but it crested at 8.3 feet at 515 PM CST Tuesday. Flood stage is 7 feet.||In the town of Elm Creek, many roads and basements were flooded. A gauge on Elm Creek indicated that the water level rose 8 feet in 2 hours Monday evening.||The city of Lexington issued a disaster declaration due to the disruption of utility services. Streets and homes were flooded with sewers backing up into homes. ||Flooding was extensive along the Wood River. Moderate flooding occurred at Riverdale with water covering the bridge just north of town. Further to the north, flooding forced the closure of state highway 10 between Pleasanton and Hazard.||In Gibbon, water flooded streets and basements for the second time this year. The northeast side of town was impacted the worst with at least 30 homes and several businesses inundated by floodwater. People had to sandbag their homes and businesses. It is believed that flooding on the Wood River was wider with this event, due to changes in the riverbed from the prior flood in March. Some places that did not flood in that event, flooded this time. Many people commented, I can't believe this has happened twice. Several businesses affected by the March flood still remained closed due to damage.||Amtrak trains that travel between Chicago and Emeryville, CA were halted in Lincoln and McCook due to the flooding. There were probably many more impacts that were not documented here as it is not possible to include everything. Widespread flooding of low-lying areas, creeks, and rivers continued for several days following the excessive rain. Flood waters did not recede in some locations until Monday, July 15th. This devastating flood occurred just four months after a catastrophic flood occurred nearby in mid-to-late March. That flood affected areas primarily along and north of the Platte River."

This main line of storms swept swiftly eastward, already departing eastern Jewell/Mitchell counties by 1:30 a.m. CDT.  To be sure, the broad mesoscale environment appeared quite supportive of potentially-widespread wind damage, featuring 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 40 knots of deep-layer wind shear. This high instability was fueled by a very humid airmass with surface dewpoints into the low-mid 70s F.

However, the aforementioned, concentrated corridor of damaging winds did not really take shape until shortly before storms entered the local area into Rooks County. In the mid-upper levels, the main instigator was a low-amplitude shortwave trough lifting east-northeast into northern Kansas from the west. At the surface, convection was largely tied to a triple point centered over western portions of the Nebraska-Kansas border, featuring the intersection of a 1000 millibar low, a north-south oriented dryline, and a northeast-southwest oriented cold front.

The team determined that the damage was due to severe thunderstorm downburst winds ranging from 65 to 80 mph. A storm spotter also |reported a measured windspeed of 80 mph from a home weather station in Seagoville during this event.||The field of wind damage was approximately 2 miles long and 2.25 miles wide, and encompassed most of the City of Seagoville, on either side of U.S. Highway 175. Snapped (and in a few cases, uprooted) tree trunks and large branches comprised the vast majority of the damage. Many trees and branches were toppled onto |homes, vehicles, storage buildings and fencing, resulting in considerable residential property damage. No injuries are known to have occurred at this time. ||Most of the trees and branches were knocked down in a quasi-unidirectional southeasterly direction, consistent with straight line winds, and with the northwest to southeast motion of the storm. However, it should be noted that a few trees/branches on the far western and northeastern edges of the downburst damage field exhibited fall orientations consistent with rotation. This may be due to the presence of very small-scale vortices that developed on the flanks of the main downburst feature as it moved |through Seagoville. The CASA radar in Mesquite observed a pronounced downburst velocity signature forming just N of Seagoville at 6:30 pm, which subsequently moved south southeastward across the city.",With June comes the season of the MCS (Mesoscale Convective System). This year was no exception as the first days of the month included storm complexes that generated spotty severe weather and localized flash flooding to parts of North Texas.

While strong gusts of 40-55 MPH were fairly common across much of the area, the primary swath of damaging winds in the 60-75 MPH range impacted Rooks, Phillips, Smith and northwestern Osborne counties. A few of the most impressive measured gusts from personal weather stations included: 75 MPH south-southwest of Stockton, 73 MPH north-northeast of Codell and 70 MPH near Damar. In addition, airport sensors at Phillipsburg and Smith Center clocked peak gusts of 62 and 59 MPH, respectively. As for actual wind damage, the majority of ground-truth reports focused in Rooks County, including downed power poles in Stockton and Zurich, and large tree branches knocked down in Plainville. ||Tracing this storm complex back to its roots, it originated in east-central Colorado during the early-to-mid afternoon, before occasionally flaring up to severe levels as it traversed parts of northwest Kansas mid-to-late afternoon. However, the aforementioned, concentrated corridor of damaging winds did not really take shape until shortly before storms entered the local area into Rooks County. In the mid-upper levels, the main instigator was a low-amplitude shortwave trough lifting east-northeast into northern Kansas from the west. At the surface, convection was largely tied to a triple point centered over western portions of the Nebraska-Kansas border, featuring the intersection of a 1000 millibar low, a north-south oriented dryline, and a northeast-southwest oriented cold front. Early evening mesoscale convective parameters in North Central Kansas featured around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of effective deep-layer wind shear."

Numerous thunderstorms developed east of the dryline which was located west of the Interstate 27/US Highway 87 corridor. Very strong instability developed out ahead of the dryline in the warm sector along with favorable shear for supercell and tornado development. Although no long track tornadoes were observed, there were several weak tornadoes that developed. The most destructive storm of the afternoon was a supercell that moved through parts of the city of Lubbock (Lubbock County). A widespread swath of wind gusts in excess of 60 mph and extensive wind damage was seen from southern Lubbock County up through the south side of Lubbock and into Idalou. Due to the fast moving nature of the thunderstorms, this damage occurred over a period of only nine minutes from 1504 through 1513 CST. Most damage reports consisted of downed trees and power lines."

For the city of Grand Island, this was likely the overall-worst wind storm in several years, as the airport ASOS clocked a peak gust of 87 MPH. Countless trees/large branches were blown down within the city, along with several power lines, and there was also some (mainly) minor structural damage. Grand Island Emergency Center logged nearly 300 storm related incidents, including traffic hazards, power outages, alarms and fire concerns from sparking electricity. The storm also caused an (indirect) traffic fatality in rural Hall County southeast of Cairo, when a man crashed his pickup into a large, downed tree arched across a paved county road. To the south in Hastings, damage was less-severe overall, as the ASOS peak gust on the west side of town was only 70 MPH. However, stronger winds likely impacted areas just east of the city, as large trees were uprooted at Central Community College and several rail cars were reportedly blown over at a repair facility near the Clay County line. Several smaller communities also reported notable wind damage, including: Cairo, Alda, Wood River, Doniphan, Glenvil, and Fairfield. West of Clay Center, fairly extensive damage occurred on the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center campus, including broken windows and roof damage to several buildings. In addition to the aforementioned peak wind gusts at Grand Island/Hastings airports, some of the more notable unofficial (mesonet) gusts included: 85 MPH near Fairfield, 80 MPH near Alda and Wood River, 79 MPH in Doniphan and 73 MPH near Nelson. Despite the multitude of damaging wind reports, hail reports were quite scarce, as the vast majority of stones were likely dime size or smaller. Rainfall-wise, a fairly widespread coverage of 2-3 soaked several northern counties including: Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Nance and Merrick. Although resultant flooding was not very extensive in most of the area, the Mira Creek in southern Valley County breached its banks for the second time in five days, again prompting minor flooding on the north side of North Loup that continued into the early morning of the 8th.||Breaking down the timing and meteorological background of this event, it's worth noting that these South Central Nebraska damaging winds were actually the finale to a much longer swath of severe weather that initiated in southern ND and north central SD during the afternoon/evening of the 6th.

In the wake of the main show, a few weaker clusters of storms redeveloped over parts of the area into the daylight hours, but were of little significance. In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this event occurred within a fairly classic summertime northwest-flow regime, as the Central Plains resided northeast of an expansive ridge centered over New Mexico.

This promoted light-but-steady, south-southeast breezes in advance of the approaching storm complex, with surface dewpoints averaging mid-upper 60s F.

Wind gusts were estimated to be near 70 to 75 MPH along this path. A light helicopter was blown over at the Hastings Airport. Quarter to half dollar size hail was also reported near the airport, which combined with intense winds to shred trees, crops and gardens, and damage house siding, in and near the west side of Hastings.","As severe storm/flooding events go, some are definitely better-anticipated than others (forecast-wise). Unfortunately, what transpired on this Thursday evening the 22nd into early Friday morning the 23rd fell into the low-predictability category, as an apparent mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) sparked isolated-but-intense thunderstorms that not only dumped flooding rains on parts of Sherman/Buffalo/Howard/Hall/Adams counties, but also brought a damaging combination of winds and hail to parts of Hall/Adams counties. Going into more detail, and starting with the severe weather aspect, around 1:30 a.m. CDT a severe thunderstorm rapidly blossomed over southern Hall County. It started drifting slowly south-southeast, reaching Hastings around 3 a.m. CDT and eventually weakening/dissipating over southern Clay County between 4-5 a.m. CDT. Along the way, this storm produced winds measured as high as 76 MPH at Hastings airport, along  with copious amounts of hail up to half dollar size. In Hall County, at least one semi truck was blown over on Interstate 80. However, Hastings was the hardest hit local community, specifically the west side of town and adjacent rural areas, where the wind/hail combo shredded trees and gardens, damaged house siding and ravaged maturing crops. Some hail drifts in/near west Hastings were still visible well into the daytime hours (side note: this was at least the third time in 2019 that severe storms impacted Hastings). Flooding was certainly an issue within Hall/Adams counties as well, particularly in the Amick Acres neighborhood west of Doniphan where a CoCoRaHS observer measured 4.54 of rain. This prompted extensive flooding of basements and overflowed a series of small lakes (at least minor flooding would continue at Amick Acres for several more days). Flooding was less-severe in the Hastings area, but there was still short-term flooding of fields and rural roads (including the brief closure of Showboat Road just east of town). ||Although the weather impacts in Hall/Adams counties dominated the local news headlines, significant-but-localized flooding also occurred in more rural areas of southern Sherman, northeastern Buffalo and southeastern Howard counties earlier in the night. Focusing on the more significant event in Sherman/Buffalo counties, a slow-moving series of re-generating storms dumped 2-5+ inches of rain along a narrow corridor from south of Loup City to south of Ravenna, with the majority falling between 7 p.m. and midnight CDT. There were a few unofficial public reports of totals as high as 7-7.50, along with some ground-truth reports of flooding/flash flooding, including water running over portions of Highways 10 and 68. As mentioned at the top, the development and intensity of these evening and overnight storms was not well-anticipated in official forecasts, as numerical models failed to latch onto the apparent influence of a pesky, slow-moving MCV that drifted eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day on the 22nd and stuck around through the night. The larger scale mid-upper air pattern over Nebraska was not very notable, featuring only subtle/low amplitude disturbances ejecting eastward from a trough centered over the Northern Rockies. Adding to the surprising intensity of this convection, mesoscale analysis depicted only weak deep-layer wind shear of no more than 25-30 knots, along with only around 1000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE."

Rainfall-wise, the heaviest overnight totals of 2.00-3.50 soaked southern portions of Rooks and Osborne counties, including a CoCoRaHS total of 3.50 in Plainville. ||Long before reaching North Central Kansas, the origins of this MCS began as scattered storms developing over southeast Colorado during the late afternoon of the 10th. As the evening wore on, this convection gradually congealed into a more organized complex as it initially drifted northeast into northwestern Kansas before taking a more easterly turn after dark, eventually reaching Phillips/Rooks counties between 12:30-1:30 a.m. CDT and exiting the local area out of Jewell/Mitchell counties by 4 a.m. CDT. In the wake of the main storm complex, widespread showers/non-severe storms lingered over parts of the area until shortly after sunrise. In the mid-upper levels, fairly weak zonal flow was in place over the Central Plains, to the north of a large-scale ridge centered over TX. Over North Central Kansas, the overnight mesoscale environment featured healthy instability (evidenced by surface dewpoints into the 70s F and mixed-layer CAPE 2000-3000 J/kg), but only 20-30 knots of deep-layer wind shear. However, the eastward propagation of the MCS was aided by warm air/moisture advection within the exit region of a 30 knot, southerly low level jet."

Along the way, the Grand Island airport ASOS measured an official 59 MPH gust and on unofficial mesonet near Polk reported 60 MPH. Ground-truth wind damage reports were quite limited, but several tree branches were downed in McCool Junction. Certainly though, the biggest impact from this event was heavy rainfall/flooding, as most places within the aforementioned swath tallied early morning amounts of 1.00-2.50, with a few higher totals including 3.00 near Cotesfield and 2.69 west of Doniphan. As a result, at least minor flooding of several creeks and rural roads occurred or continued within several local counties, including along the West Fork Big Blue River between Hastings and McCool Junction. Among a few of the more newsworthy flooding impacts, Grand Island not only saw widespread short-term street flooding, but the State Fairgrounds were swamped with several inches of standing water for a few hours, disrupting Day 4 of the Nebraska State Fair.

There was considerable crop damage in the area, including at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center located west of Clay Center, where several buildings were also damaged.","Although its main damage swath was only about 15 miles wide, the narrow-but-intense severe storm complex that raced from northwest-to-southeast through the heart of South Central Nebraska during the pre-dawn hours on this Wednesday was one of the most impactful events of the local convective season. Quite simply, this was a nasty wind storm, packing a punch with gusts ranging from around 60 to nearly 90 MPH along and several miles either side of a line stretching from Ord-Grand Island-Hastings-Hardy. For the city of Grand Island, this was likely the overall-worst wind storm in several years, as the airport ASOS clocked a peak gust of 87 MPH. Countless trees/large branches were blown down within the city, along with several power lines, and there was also some (mainly) minor structural damage. Grand Island Emergency Center logged nearly 300 storm related incidents, including traffic hazards, power outages, alarms and fire concerns from sparking electricity. The storm also caused an (indirect) traffic fatality in rural Hall County southeast of Cairo, when a man crashed his pickup into a large, downed tree arched across a paved county road. To the south in Hastings, damage was less-severe overall, as the ASOS peak gust on the west side of town was only 70 MPH. However, stronger winds likely impacted areas just east of the city, as large trees were uprooted at Central Community College and several rail cars were reportedly blown over at a repair facility near the Clay County line. Several smaller communities also reported notable wind damage, including: Cairo, Alda, Wood River, Doniphan, Glenvil, and Fairfield. West of Clay Center, fairly extensive damage occurred on the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center campus, including broken windows and roof damage to several buildings. In addition to the aforementioned peak wind gusts at Grand Island/Hastings airports, some of the more notable unofficial (mesonet) gusts included: 85 MPH near Fairfield, 80 MPH near Alda and Wood River, 79 MPH in Doniphan and 73 MPH near Nelson. Despite the multitude of damaging wind reports, hail reports were quite scarce, as the vast majority of stones were likely dime size or smaller. Rainfall-wise, a fairly widespread coverage of 2-3 soaked several northern counties including: Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Nance and Merrick. Although resultant flooding was not very extensive in most of the area, the Mira Creek in southern Valley County breached its banks for the second time in five days, again prompting minor flooding on the north side of North Loup that continued into the early morning of the 8th.||Breaking down the timing and meteorological background of this event, it's worth noting that these South Central Nebraska damaging winds were actually the finale to a much longer swath of severe weather that initiated in southern ND and north central SD during the afternoon/evening of the 6th. Between 1-2 a.m. CDT on the 7th, the leading edge of this narrow-but-potent mesoscale convective system (MCS) entered far northern portions of the local area into Valley/Greeley counties, signaling its arrival with a 59 MPH gust at Ord airport. However, the worst was yet to come, as during the next few hours the storm complex morphed into more of an outflow-dominant, high-precipitation supercell, slamming through the Grand Island/Hastings areas between 2:30-3:30 a.m. CDT before eventually exiting Nuckolls/Thayer counties into Kansas by 5 a.m. CDT. In the wake of the main show, a few weaker clusters of storms redeveloped over parts of the area into the daylight hours, but were of little significance. In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this event occurred within a fairly classic summertime northwest-flow regime, as the Central Plains resided northeast of an expansive ridge centered over New Mexico. At the surface, South Central Nebraska was on the backside of a weak ridge axis centered near the Nebraska-Iowa border. This promoted light-but-steady, south-southeast breezes in advance of the approaching storm complex, with surface dewpoints averaging mid-upper 60s F. Although there were question marks about how far southward into Nebraska the potential severe weather threat would extend, the combination of seasonably-stout flow aloft (deep-layer wind shear of at least 40-60 knots) and sufficient instability (mixed-layer CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg) was clearly supportive of an intense late-night storm.

In addition to the aforementioned peak wind gusts at Grand Island/Hastings airports, some of the more notable unofficial (mesonet) gusts included: 85 MPH near Fairfield, 80 MPH near Alda and Wood River, 79 MPH in Doniphan and 73 MPH near Nelson. Despite the multitude of damaging wind reports, hail reports were quite scarce, as the vast majority of stones were likely dime size or smaller.

However, the worst was yet to come, as during the next few hours the storm complex morphed into more of an outflow-dominant, high-precipitation supercell, slamming through the Grand Island/Hastings areas between 2:30-3:30 a.m. CDT before eventually exiting Nuckolls/Thayer counties into Kansas by 5 a.m. CDT. In the wake of the main show, a few weaker clusters of storms redeveloped over parts of the area into the daylight hours, but were of little significance. In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this event occurred within a fairly classic summertime northwest-flow regime, as the Central Plains resided northeast of an expansive ridge centered over New Mexico. At the surface, South Central Nebraska was on the backside of a weak ridge axis centered near the Nebraska-Iowa border. This promoted light-but-steady, south-southeast breezes in advance of the approaching storm complex, with surface dewpoints averaging mid-upper 60s F. Although there were question marks about how far southward into Nebraska the potential severe weather threat would extend, the combination of seasonably-stout flow aloft (deep-layer wind shear of at least 40-60 knots) and sufficient instability (mixed-layer CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg) was clearly supportive of an intense late-night storm. Also enhancing the severe weather environment was a modest, 30 knot  southwesterly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) and its associated low-level warm air/moisture advection."

Quite simply, this was a nasty wind storm, packing a punch with gusts ranging from around 60 to nearly 90 MPH along and several miles either side of a line stretching from Ord-Grand Island-Hastings-Hardy. For the city of Grand Island, this was likely the overall-worst wind storm in several years, as the airport ASOS clocked a peak gust of 87 MPH. Countless trees/large branches were blown down within the city, along with several power lines, and there was also some (mainly) minor structural damage. Grand Island Emergency Center logged nearly 300 storm related incidents, including traffic hazards, power outages, alarms and fire concerns from sparking electricity. The storm also caused an (indirect) traffic fatality in rural Hall County southeast of Cairo, when a man crashed his pickup into a large, downed tree arched across a paved county road. To the south in Hastings, damage was less-severe overall, as the ASOS peak gust on the west side of town was only 70 MPH. However, stronger winds likely impacted areas just east of the city, as large trees were uprooted at Central Community College and several rail cars were reportedly blown over at a repair facility near the Clay County line. Several smaller communities also reported notable wind damage, including: Cairo, Alda, Wood River, Doniphan, Glenvil, and Fairfield.

There were only a few ground-truth reports of severe-criteria gusts, from mesonet stations near Stockton (59 MPH), Cawker City (75 MPH, along with a report of tree limbs down at Glen Elder State Park), and Beloit (73 MPH). Rainfall-wise, the heaviest overnight totals of 2.00-3.50 soaked southern portions of Rooks and Osborne counties, including a CoCoRaHS total of 3.50 in Plainville. ||Long before reaching North Central Kansas, the origins of this MCS began as scattered storms developing over southeast Colorado during the late afternoon of the 10th. As the evening wore on, this convection gradually congealed into a more organized complex as it initially drifted northeast into northwestern Kansas before taking a more easterly turn after dark, eventually reaching Phillips/Rooks counties between 12:30-1:30 a.m. CDT and exiting the local area out of Jewell/Mitchell counties by 4 a.m. CDT. In the wake of the main storm complex, widespread showers/non-severe storms lingered over parts of the area until shortly after sunrise. In the mid-upper levels, fairly weak zonal flow was in place over the Central Plains, to the north of a large-scale ridge centered over TX. Over North Central Kansas, the overnight mesoscale environment featured healthy instability (evidenced by surface dewpoints into the 70s F and mixed-layer CAPE 2000-3000 J/kg), but only 20-30 knots of deep-layer wind shear. However, the eastward propagation of the MCS was aided by warm air/moisture advection within the exit region of a 30 knot, southerly low level jet."

These winds may have been in conjunction with a rear-flank downdraft.","A surface trough over eastern Montana nudging into western North Dakota served as the focus for thunderstorm development in a highly sheared environment. Initial severe thunderstorms moved into northwest North Dakota from Montana, with additional development following over southwest North Dakota. A tornado developed over Hettinger County and struck the northeast part of the city of Mott, causing damage that corresponded to EF1. Most of the severe weather remained over western North Dakota, though a late night severe storm developed over northern Burleigh County, causing extensive wind damage to a farmstead near the city of Regan. During this episode, the largest hail reported was golf ball size and fell in Stark County. The strongest wind gusts were 90 mph, and occurred in Hettinger and Burleigh counties."
