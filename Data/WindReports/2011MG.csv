279372,3/23/2011 0:12,50,MG,nan,"Low pressure formed to the west of Iowa and during the morning it was located over central Nebraska with a warm front extending east-southeast across southern Iowa.  The low advanced east during the day as the warm front moved little.  Initially, the airmass was capped by a strong elevated mixed layer.  During the late afternoon and early evening hours, a strong upper level short wave moved into the area.  Temperatures aloft fell rapidly, destabilizing the atmosphere.  Meanwhile, a strong low level jet formed ahead of the approaching low with winds of 40 to 50 kts.  This helped to bring in moisture and increased the precipitable water values to around an inch over much of Iowa.  By late afternoon, most unstable CAPE values were in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  Surface lifted indices were not all that impressive, however the elevated values were in the -3 to -6 C range.  The atmosphere was strongly sheared with 50 to 70 kts of available shear.  The LCL values were quite low as strong heating had not taken place during the day.  LCL heights were between 500 and 1000 meters.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high with values just ahead of the convection between 700 and 1000 J/kg.  The freezing level was quite low, near 11,000 feet, and available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 400 and 500 J/kg.  Thunderstorms fired along and just south of the surface low along a dry line ahead of the associated cold front.  Convection was strong and moved rapidly northeast.  There were two areas of thunderstorms.  A line of strong to severe thunderstorms formed just ahead of the cold front, with more isolated severe convection forming ahead of the main line.  There were numerous reports of tornadoes, mainly with the leading convection.  The three strongest tornadoes took place west to northwest of Creston in Union County, and northwest to north of Winterset in Madison County and southeast of Massena in Cass County.  The tornado in Cass County touched down approximately 1/2 mile east of the intersection of Iowa Hwy 148 and County Hwy G61. It damaged the canopy to an outdoor storage building and tipped over some industrial machinery. It continued northeast and damaged a structure...and caused some minor additional damage to a farmstead north of the intersection of County Hwy G61 and 760th St. Finally, it damaged some outdoor storage bins south of the intersection of County Hwy G53 and 770th Street.  It then lifted.  The same parent storm continued northeast and a small EF0 tornado touched down briefly near Bridgewater in Adair County.  In Madison County, A tornado touched down 10 miles northwest of Winterset. The tornado was characterized by a large circulation up to 0.8 tenths of a mile wide (Iowa Helicopter) and generally of EF1 (90-100 MPH wind) strength.   Eyewitnesses report the tornado was rain wrapped and difficult to distinguish from the rain shield as it approached them from the southwest. The tornado moved across several residences, many of which had broken windows and some roof damage along with significant tree and outbuilding damage. One newly constructed house that was near completion, slid off its foundation with the metal tie down straps either sheered off or pulled out of the concrete foundation. This damage is consistent with winds around 120 MPH which are EF2 strength. The roof structure remained intact and was aided by hurricane clips. Several other residences suffered partial roof removal with no hurricane clips noted. One other location had numerous trees either uprooted or topped and several outbuildings with the roofs blown off.  Objects near the ground did not suffer near as much damage suggesting the peak winds at this location were just off the surface. The tornado lifted around 10 miles north northeast of Winterset or 5 miles south of Van Meter around 1735 CST. The tornado in Union County was not as intense, with damage there relatively minor.  In addition to the line of severe thunderstorms, there was also convection that developed to the north of the low pressure track.  Outside of the tornadic storms, the primary mode of severe weather was hail.  There were reports of hail with most of the storms as they passed, with several reports of hail from quarter up to golf ball in size.  Hail caused damage to roofs and vehicles.  Fortunately, the crops had not been planted so there wasnt any agricultural loss.  A few reports of strong winds were received with wind gusts in the 60 to 65 MPH range.  Some tree and power line damage occurred, but it was not widespread.  Heavy rainfall caused minor flooding in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  A rainfall of 1.73 inches in under 2 hours in West Des Moines resulted in minor urban flooding along EP True Parkway.  Water was standing 1 to 2 feet deep in low drainage areas along the parkway.  There were also numerous reports of urban flooding around the city with water standing in intersections.  As the thunderstorms moved through Butler County, lightning struck a barn near Shell Rock.  The lightning caused damage to the barn and a minor fire.",42.4,-94.63

A vigorous short wave trough was moving into the upper Midwest, while a surface low strengthened from Nebraska to southern Minnesota. This pulled a warm front across the region allowing for ample moisture and sufficient instability to trigger severe thunderstorms. There were several penny to nickel size hail reports across eastern Iowa, northwest Illinois and extreme northeast Missouri. Some of the storms also produced wind gusts to near 60 mph. However, no damage was reported. A trained spotter near Mediapolis, Iowa in Des Moines county estimated a wind gust of 60 mph.

An area of low pressure moved from the Texas Hill Country into Northeast Texas during the afternoon.  Meanwhile, a warm front had moved northward from central Louisiana and was oriented west to east near the Arkansas/Louisiana state line.  A dry line had moved just east of the I-35 corridor of North Central Texas and a strong cold front trailed the dry line.  Very strong speed and directional shear was noted in the low and mid levels of the atmosphere such that supercells developed.  Many of these produced tornadoes across the region. Other storms produced strong straight line wind gusts with bowing segments and large hail.",33.22,-92.78
311129,4/27/2011 9:21,50,MG,Measured at Naval Air Station Meridian (NMM).,"A historic outbreak of tornadoes across the Ark-La-Miss began late on Tuesday, April 26th continuing into the early morning hours of Wednesday, April 27th. The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.  The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.  By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on “classic” supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.  Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.",32.55,-88.62

The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast. Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county.

Along nearly the entire length of this northeast-southwest oriented squall line were estimated or measured wind gusts of 60-70 MPH, with a home weather station near Webber in Jewell County recording the highest known measured gust of 72 MPH. Other measured wind gusts included 69 MPH at the Smith Center airport, and 58 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport. Although specific reports of damage were limited, there was likely at least minor tree and power line damage in parts of the area. Along with the winds, there were also a few reports of quarter size hail.    Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development along the squall line took place to the north across central and south central Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The line of storms eventually built south into Kansas as it moved east, first affecting Phillips and Rooks Counties between 8 and 9 PM CDT, and eventually exiting Jewell and Mitchell Counties between 1130 PM and 1230 AM CDT.   The synoptic and mesoscale environment was certainly ripe for a damaging, linear wind event. Earlier in the day, a strong pressure gradient brought hours of sustained 30-40 MPH winds and frequent gusts of 45-50 MPH to North Central Kansas, as a 994 millibar surface low pressure system organized near the Colorado-Kansas border. Aloft, a powerful, negatively tilted upper level trough centered across the Central and Northern Rockies gradually ejected northeast toward the Northern Plains, allowing considerable large scale forcing and increasing wind fields to overspread northern Kansas, including 60-70 knot southwesterly flow at 500 millibars. Lower in the atmosphere, southerly low-level jet winds at 850 millibars increased to around 60 knots. At the surface, a pronounced cold front sliced through the area, providing sharp linear forcing for development of the squall line. Mesoscale severe weather parameters at mid-evening included mixed layer CAPE values around 2500 J/kg, and deep-layer vertical wind shear of at least 40-60 knots.

It moved southeast into the rich air over Iowa and accelerated, becoming a derecho.  A large area of high winds developed with widespread wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH, mainly over the southwest half of the CWA.  The storms also produced hail at most locations as it passed.  Most of the hail was around an inch or so in diameter.  A smaller area of thunderstorms formed over southeast Iowa, ahead of the main area.  These storms produced hail up to golf ball in size, along with 60 MPH winds during the early evening.  The largest hail reported was 2 inches in diameter in Cincinnati in Appanoose County.  The storms produced copious rainfall in spite of their rapid movement.  Flash flooding was reported in Union, Adair, Davis, and Adams Counties.  For the most part the flash flooding was relatively minor, limited to water flowing rapidly over roads.  In Davis County at Bloomfield, water blew off manhole covers and was deep enough to nearly reach the tops of car roofs.  The thunderstorm winds caused widespread damage to trees and power lines.

These storms forced delays or cancellations to a number of high school football games during what turned into a fairly prolonged event, with wind and hail-producing storms first flaring up around 230 PM CDT, and finally diminishing in intensity around 1 AM. The majority of severe storms and heavy rainfall regenerated for several hours within a narrow southwest-northeast oriented corridor only about 30 miles wide at most, primarily impacting counties such as Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo, Howard, Hall and northwest Adams. The storm mode was a mixed bag of quasi-discrete, fast moving supercells and small multicell bowing segments. Storm reports included several instances of damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of golf balls. A few of the more notable reports were from Atlanta in Phelps County, including golf ball size hail and significant wind damage to the roof of a grain storage building. At the Holdrege airport, two separate storms produced measured gusts to around 60 MPH, several hours apart from one another. Although a few storms exhibited low-level rotation, no tornadoes occurred.   Heavy rainfall-wise, parts of primarily eastern Furnas, northwest Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo and southeast Sherman Counties measured 3-6 inches of rain during this event, including 5.94 inches northwest of Oxford and 5.33 inches in Loomis. Kearney Regional Airport established a record for the date with 2.29 inches. Although the heaviest rain associated with this low pressure system fell during these storms on the afternoon and evening of the 7th, additional rain throughout the weekend boosted 3-day totals into the 6-7 inch range for some areas, highlighted by 7.13 inches at Loomis. Fortunately, due to the very dry conditions leading up to this event, widespread flooding impacts were held to a minimum.   On the synoptic scale, the primary trigger for severe weather was the approach of a highly amplified mid-level trough across the western United States, anchored by a closed low swinging through the Four Corners region. Downstream from this low, a corridor of strong, nearly unidirectional south-southwest winds was in place in the mid and upper levels. At the surface, storm development focused along a quasi-stationary front, which at mid-afternoon stretched from eastern South Dakota to southwest Kansas. Given that winds aloft were largely parallel to this southwest-northeast oriented surface front, convection was able to focus within the aforementioned narrow corridor, with individual storms within the corridor racing northeast. Mesoscale parameters at early evening revealed only modest instability, with mixed-layer CAPE values only around 1000 J/kg, but in the presence of very strong deep-layer vertical wind shear of 50-60 knots. Although low-level shear ramped up as the evening progressed, with 0-1 kilometer shear values increasing to 30-40 knots, the combination of increasing low level convective inhibition and multiple storm mergers likely helped mitigate a potential tornadic threat.",40.45,-99.33

However as the storm system approached, a surface low pressure area formed along the frontal boundary, which helped to draw warm and humid conditions northward into the Coastal Bend.   As the upper level storm system moved through the region, very strong wind shear developed and combined with an unstable atmosphere to produce a line of severe thunderstorms. A tornadic thunderstorm developed near the proximity of the surface low and retreating warm front, which persisted for over 20 miles travelling from just southeast of Alice to near Calallen. Damaging straight line winds affected most of the Coastal Bend and extended well into the Gulf of Mexico east of Rockport. Widespread wind damage was observed across the Coastal Bend as the storms moved quickly through the region. Approximately 30,000 customers lost power as a result of the storms. This marks the first time a tornado has been recorded in South Texas in the month of January, dating back to 1950. Property damage for the tornado and straight-line winds for the Coastal Bend was estimated to be around 10 million dollars.    From Calallen through Portland and Rockport, doppler radar indicated a broad, yet strong rotation between 4 and 430 AM CST.

In the wake of this system, hundreds of people were left injured and/or homeless, along with approximately 100 people who lost their lives in the northern Alabama area alone. Some of the devastation was literally unimaginable with countless homes, neighborhoods and even portions of cities or towns either partially or completely destroyed. This storm system would be responsible for one of the largest and deadliest tornado outbreaks to ever impact much of the southeastern region.   The powerful storm system that affected the National Weather Service, Huntsville service area would actually occur in three separate waves of severe weather that day. The first occurred during the early morning hours of April 27, 2011 roughly between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM CDT, while the second occurred during the late-morning to early afternoon period. The third and most devastating wave occurred during the afternoon hours on Wednesday, with some of the most violent and destructive tornadoes to affect the central Tennessee Valley area in recent decades.   The worst areas impacted by these storms included the towns of Phil Campbell and Oak Grove in eastern Franklin County Alabama, Mt. Hope in western Lawrence County and the Tanner Community in eastern Limestone County. Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.   Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County. In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities in DeKalb County alone numbered at least 33 people. Furthermore, the towns of Flat Rock, Higdon and Pisgah in Jackson County sustained incredible damage. The tornadoes that affected these areas were rated as an EF4 with maximum winds near 190 mph.  In most of these areas alone, numerous people lost their lives. These represent just several of the communities and towns impacted by the events of April 27, 2011.

316936,5/31/2011 2:48,51,MG,nan,"The evening hours of Memorial Day 2011 featured the most widespread damaging wind event of the spring severe weather season across South Central Nebraska, as a narrow, intense line of storms marched from west to east across the entire area. Along nearly the entire length of this north-south oriented squall line were estimated or measured wind gusts of 60-80 MPH, with automated equipment at the Lexington airport recording the highest-known measured gust of 90 MPH. As a result, widespread wind damage primarily to trees, power lines and outbuildings occurred across multiple counties. Although there several preliminary reports of brief tornadoes along the leading edge of the squall line, including one near Cozad early in the evening, radar data along with photographic and video evidence suggests that the vast majority of these reports were actually gustnadoes, which are brief, but sometimes strong circulations associated with outflow and not connected to cloud base rotation. Most of these gustnado reports focused west of the Highway 281 corridor. In addition, there were also sporadic reports of quarter size hail, but damaging straight-line wind along the surging outflow was the main story by far. Just to name a few, wind highlights included: a measured 74 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island with several reports of structural damage within the city including a destroyed mini-storage building; a measured gust to 83 MPH at the Ord airport with considerable damage to a hangar; three empty grain bins blown off their foundations and an unsecured trailer rolled near Strang in Fillmore County.   Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development took place across north central Nebraska during mid-afternoon, with the developing severe squall line first creeping southward into western Dawson County around 7 PM CDT. Thereafter, the line continued to build south into Kansas as it marched east, crossing the Highway 281 corridor mainly between 9 and 10 PM CDT, and finally exiting eastern portions of South Central Nebraska between 11 PM and midnight CDT.   The synoptic and mesoscale environment was certainly ripe for a damaging, linear wind event. Earlier in the day, a strong pressure gradient brought hours of sustained 30-40 MPH winds and frequent gusts of 45-55 MPH to South Central Nebraska, as a 994 millibar surface low pressure system organized near the Colorado-Kansas border. Aloft, a powerful, negatively tilted upper level trough centered across the Central and Northern Rockies gradually ejected northeast toward the Northern Plains, allowing considerable large scale forcing and increasing wind fields to overspread Nebraska, including 60-80 knot southwesterly flow at 500 millibars. Lower in the atmosphere, southerly low-level jet winds at 850 millibars increased to around 60 knots. At the surface, a pronounced cold front sliced through the area, providing sharp linear forcing for development of the squall line. Mesoscale severe weather parameters early in the evening included mixed layer CAPE values around 2500 J/kg, and deep-layer vertical wind shear generally 50-70 knots.

An outflow boundary was located across northern Iowa from the complex in Minnesota, enhancing convection there.  As the storms moved into Iowa, the primary threat came in the form of wind with wind gusts of 40 to 60 MPH associated with the fast moving forward propagating MCS.  Wind damage occurred in the Atlantic area with a tree blocking U.S. Highway 6.  This cluster of storms continued to move across the state at around 55 MPH.  Wind damage occurred in the Des Moines area with tree branches down and power line damage caused by 60 MPH winds.  A 59 MPH wind gust was recorded at the Ames Airport as the storms passed.  As the complex of storms continued east out of central Iowa, widespread damage occurred across Marshall and Tama Counties with winds of 70 to 100 MPH.  Two radio towers were downed, one in central Tama County, the other in northern Polk County.  A local television stations weather radar was destroyed near Alleman, also in Polk County.  Local wind speeds in these areas were estimated as high as 115 MPH.  Widespread power outages were reported with 90% of the power still out in Marshall County, and 75% out in Tama County 12 hours after the event.  Power was out for 3 to 4 days in some places.  Governor Terry Brandstad gave a State Disaster Proclamation to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties due the extensive damage.  A presidential declaration for major disaster was also given to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties.  A broad area of severe damage occurred with a path 5 miles wide of EF1 type damage caused by the high winds.  A path, 10 miles wide, of 70 to 80 MPH was surveyed, with a 15 to 20 mile wide path of wind speeds above 60 MPH.  The damage swath was nearly continuous with no evidence of tornadoes.  It extended from southern Story and northern Polk Counties, through Marshall, and Tama Counties, and was about 75 miles in length before exiting the CWA.  Crop losses were substantial with around 40% or greater loss on over 100,000 acres of corn and soy beans.  The corn had much more damage than the bean plants, with damage on these acres estimated at $95,000,000.  Other damage occurred around the area as well.  This derecho event was the most widespread one to affect central and east central Iowa since the June 1998 event.  Some examples of the notable wind speeds estimated from the survey include 96 MPH near Huxley, 94 MPH near Maxwell, 70 to 90 MPH near Marshalltown, 105 MPH east of Garwin, 85 to 97 MPH between Garwin and Union Grove State Park, 100 MPH south of Traer, and south to southwest of Dysart 105 to 115 MPH, with 80 to 100 MPH winds just south of that part of the swath.

The battleground between these two types of air mass, established itself from Nebraska to western Iowa, northern Kansas, and northern Missouri.   Severe thunderstorms developed during the evening and overnight hours of Thursday August 18th and 19th, 2011. Scattered supercell thunderstorms developed over eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, producing very large hail and heavy rain.

344951,10/7/2011 22:43,51,MG,nan,"Ending a stretch of 2.5 weeks of bone-dry weather, and also ending a streak of nearly six weeks with no severe thunderstorms in the 24-county area, this Friday afternoon and evening featured a concentrated corridor of strong to severe storms and heavy rainfall mainly across western portions of South Central Nebraska. These storms forced delays or cancellations to a number of high school football games during what turned into a fairly prolonged event, with wind and hail-producing storms first flaring up around 230 PM CDT, and finally diminishing in intensity around 1 AM. The majority of severe storms and heavy rainfall regenerated for several hours within a narrow southwest-northeast oriented corridor only about 30 miles wide at most, primarily impacting counties such as Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo, Howard, Hall and northwest Adams. The storm mode was a mixed bag of quasi-discrete, fast moving supercells and small multicell bowing segments. Storm reports included several instances of damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of golf balls. A few of the more notable reports were from Atlanta in Phelps County, including golf ball size hail and significant wind damage to the roof of a grain storage building. At the Holdrege airport, two separate storms produced measured gusts to around 60 MPH, several hours apart from one another. Although a few storms exhibited low-level rotation, no tornadoes occurred.   Heavy rainfall-wise, parts of primarily eastern Furnas, northwest Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo and southeast Sherman Counties measured 3-6 inches of rain during this event, including 5.94 inches northwest of Oxford and 5.33 inches in Loomis. Kearney Regional Airport established a record for the date with 2.29 inches. Although the heaviest rain associated with this low pressure system fell during these storms on the afternoon and evening of the 7th, additional rain throughout the weekend boosted 3-day totals into the 6-7 inch range for some areas, highlighted by 7.13 inches at Loomis. Fortunately, due to the very dry conditions leading up to this event, widespread flooding impacts were held to a minimum.   On the synoptic scale, the primary trigger for severe weather was the approach of a highly amplified mid-level trough across the western United States, anchored by a closed low swinging through the Four Corners region. Downstream from this low, a corridor of strong, nearly unidirectional south-southwest winds was in place in the mid and upper levels. At the surface, storm development focused along a quasi-stationary front, which at mid-afternoon stretched from eastern South Dakota to southwest Kansas. Given that winds aloft were largely parallel to this southwest-northeast oriented surface front, convection was able to focus within the aforementioned narrow corridor, with individual storms within the corridor racing northeast. Mesoscale parameters at early evening revealed only modest instability, with mixed-layer CAPE values only around 1000 J/kg, but in the presence of very strong deep-layer vertical wind shear of 50-60 knots. Although low-level shear ramped up as the evening progressed, with 0-1 kilometer shear values increasing to 30-40 knots, the combination of increasing low level convective inhibition and multiple storm mergers likely helped mitigate a potential tornadic threat.",40.73,-99

290671,5/11/2011 23:54,52,MG,nan,"A very warm and humid airmass was in place over Iowa on the 11th.  During the previous two days, strong capping was in place across the state.  A cold front began to move into the state on the 11th as upper level heights and temperatures began to fall.  The front stalled however, and the atmosphere became unstable due to the cooling aloft.  The freezing level was relatively low on the 11th as it fell to under 12,000 feet.  Most unstable CAPE was in the 1500 to 2500 J/kg range by the afternoon as lifted indices fell to -4 to -7 C.  The atmosphere exhibited weak shear with 25 kts or less of effective shear during the afternoon.  The potential was there for high winds, as well as hail, with downdraft CAPE in the 500-900 J/kg range, and CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere between 100 and 400 J/kg.  Helicity values in the 0-1 km layer increased sharply over southwest Iowa and were between 100 and 200 by mid to late afternoon.  In addition, considerable moisture pooling took place with precipitable water values increasing to 1.3 to 1.6 inches over the southwest half of Iowa by evening.  The LCL level was quite high initially, around 1500 meters, but lowered to between 500 and 1000 meters by mid to late afternoon as continued convection moistened the atmosphere.  An initial round of thunderstorms moved through the state during the morning of the 11th.  Thunderstorms continued to develop intermittently over southwest Iowa during the late morning into the afternoon.  The thunderstorms became more organized by mid to late afternoon as an upper level disturbance moved into the state from the south.  Thunderstorms became stronger and produced several tornadoes in Adams and Taylor Counties.  There were two brief touchdowns reported that caused no damage.  One was in Taylor County near Sharpsburg, the other near Kent in Adams County.  Two tornadoes moved through the town of Lenox in Taylor County.  The first tornado touched down in south central Lenox along South Maple Street, between West Platte Street and West Iowa Street Before moving north in a curving path until it reached Walnut Street. The  tornado then moved generally due north, along Walnut Street, eventually dissipating about one block north of West Van Buren Street around 1540 CST.  The damage path was generally diffuse with tree damage and shingles removed from buildings. The  greatest damage occurred along North Main Street, where two brick buildings received roof and upper facade damage.   A second tornado moved into Lenox a short time later.  The tornado touched down in the southwest part of Lenox near the intersection of State Highway 49 and West Platte Street, only a couple blocks southwest of the touchdown location of tornado number 1. The tornado traveled northward along State Highway 49, with the greatest damage occurring shortly after touchdown along Highway 49 between West Iowa Street and West Illinois Street. In that area, one house sustained damage to a second story dormer. Also in that area, a manufactured home on a foundation had approximately one half of its roof removed. The tornado then continued north along State Highway 49 generally causing tree damage and shingles to be removed from roofs. Eventually the tornado turned northwest just north of West Temple Street where an older home which housed a business had its roof removed. Shingle and tree damage continued as the tornado tracked northwest before finally exiting Lenox along Van Buren Street west of North Spear Street.  The tornado continued over open fields before dissipating about one half mile northwest of Lenox around 1548 CST.  There was considerable damage done in the town of Lenox over a 35 square block area.  Damage was in the millions of dollars.  Reports indicated that at least 45% of the homes in the city of 1407 people were damaged by the tornadoes.  One hundred and sixty trees were downed as well.  The next day, Governor Terry Branstad proclaimed a Disaster Declaration for Taylor County.  In addition to the tornadoes, there were numerous reports of high winds and hail.  Most of the hail was around an inch in diameter with the largest report being around 2 inches in diameter in Adams County.  After the storms began to weaken and move out of southwest Iowa, they produced high winds with several reports of 60 to 65 MPH winds.  Heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches occurred in parts of southwest and south central Iowa with rainfall rates exceeding 2 inches per hour.  Flash flooding occurred in Union, Adams, and Taylor Counties.  Numerous roads were flooded and became impassible, along with a few state highways.  Soil erosion was severe, especially in Taylor County.  The heavy rainfall occurred during the worst possible time, right after planting.  The soil had been freshly plowed and much of it was loose.  Damage from soil erosion was many times more costly than the damage caused by the tornadoes.  As the storms moved through the Johnston area, lightning struck outside of a house.  The lightning entered the house via an invisible dog fence, causing a small fire inside of the house as the control unit was set on fire.  Lightning struck a house in Creston.

A nearly stationary frontal boundary was in place across the state extending from the east central counties to the southwest corner of the state.  Thunderstorms erupted on the north side of the front during the evening.  CAPE values were between 2000 and 4000 J/kg, with downdraft CAPE of 1100 to 1600 J/kg.  The lifted index was in the -4 to -6 C range.  The freezing level was quite high, though it had fallen some during the day.  It was just over 14,000 feet by evening.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg.  Moisture was drawn north over the frontal boundary by a low level jet of 25 kts.  Precipitable water values increased to 1.6 to 1.9 inches.  The storms produced high winds as they progressed across the state.  One storm broke several 10 inch branches south of Hubbard in Hardin County.  This storm continued eastward and produced strong winds as it moved through Black Hawk County.  Winds were measured around 60 MPH in the Waterloo area.  Another cluster of storms moved into western Iowa and spread into the central counties.  Winds around 75 MPH occurred in Audubon County.  The strong winds, at least 60 MPH, continued east into Guthrie County before the storms weakened.  There were numerous reports of trees downed, along with power line damage.  Extensive damage occurred in Hardin County as winds of 75 MPH caused crop damage, ripped part of the roof off of a machine shed, and flattened several grain bins.  A classic wet microburst took place south of Hubbard as well.  Winds started around 1030 PM and lasted for about 8 minutes.  The damage was concentrated in an area about 2 miles south of Hubbard where 3 farms sustained major damage,  and a 4th farm had more minor damage.  Specifically, one farm lost 12 trees (snapped).  Two trees landed on and destroyed a grain bin.  Also, the west-facing machine shed door was collapsed and portions of the roof (including the roof structure itself) were blown off.   The next 2 farms to the south also sustained significant damage to trees with many snapped about halfway up the trunk.  The farm just to the north also lost several large trees.  Based on the duration of the winds, damage to the farms, type and condition of the trees, etc., estimated winds were in the 80-85 MPH range.  In terms of crops, most of these farms are growing soybeans which were flattened, and part of the corn crop was blown down. Heavy rain also was reported in Bremer County with reports of around 3 inches of rain in under 2 hours.  Around 2 inches of rain fell in an hour in Black Hawk County.

332018,9/5/2011 18:58,52,MG,A 60 mph wind gust was measured at KECP airport.,"A fairly widespread outbreak of severe thunderstorms occurred on Labor Day across much of the NWS Tallahassee County Warning Area (CWA).  This event was forced by unseasonably strong wind fields associated with a potent extra-tropical cyclone that was formerly Tropical Storm Lee.  Post-tropical cyclone Lee was moving slowly toward the east-northeast along the north central Gulf Coast during the morning hours of September 5, 2011.  By 3:00 pm EDT (1900 UTC), the cyclone was centered near Mobile Bay.  It was at this point that the system finally began to accelerate off to the northeast.  While tornadoes were initially considered to be the primary threat, examination of a special 1800 UTC KTAE sounding showed that low level winds had veered and that the flow was unidirectional through a deep layer.  WFO Tallahassee coordinated with the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) to replace the existing tornado watch with a severe thunderstorm watch at 4:00 pm EDT (2000 UTC).  WFO Tallahassee issued a total of 35 convective warnings during the event along with several special marine warnings.  A total of 52 severe weather reports were received across southeast Alabama, southwest and south central Georgia, and the Florida panhandle and big bend.    Aside from the severe weather, the forecast area experienced other peripheral impacts from post-tropical storm Lee. Widespread storm-total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches was measured across the Florida panhandle and big bend, with 1 to 2 inch totals more common across the Alabama and Georgia portions of the CWA.  The Apalachicola and Cedar Key tide gauges showed that tidal departures ran just over 2 feet above normal along the Florida big bend coastline during the high tide cycle of Tuesday morning, September 6. For the most part, flooding was avoided. The water rose up to the top of the sea walls in Dixie County, and there was some minor flooding in Wakulla County where the emergency manager reported about a 2-inch over-wash in St. Marks on Old Fort Rd.  The pressure gradient associated with Post-Tropical Storm Lee produced occasional strong wind gusts across Wakulla county for around 10 hours.  These strong wind gusts, combined with periods of heavy rain and wet soils, led to numerous trees and power lines falling throughout the day and into the evening hours.  The emergency manager reported a total of 16 trees down and 28 power lines down by the end of the day.  Of those 28 power lines, 10 of them sparked fires as a result of blowing down.",30.36,-85.8

The airmass became very unstable with the lifted index falling to around -8 and CAPE in excess of 4000 J/kg.  The atmosphere was quite warm with the freezing level between 15,000 and 16,000 feet.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was around 600 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high, in the 1200 to 1500 J/kg range.  Considerable shear was available with shear in the 50 to 65 kt range.  Meanwhile, a strong mid level trough of low pressure approached the central U.S. along with a moderate cold front approaching from the northwest.  During the night, the low level jet increased to 70 kts, further feeding the thunderstorms.  A large complex of thunderstorms developed across South Dakota into Nebraska.  It moved southeast into the rich air over Iowa and accelerated, becoming a derecho.  A large area of high winds developed with widespread wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH, mainly over the southwest half of the CWA.  The storms also produced hail at most locations as it passed.  Most of the hail was around an inch or so in diameter.  A smaller area of thunderstorms formed over southeast Iowa, ahead of the main area.  These storms produced hail up to golf ball in size, along with 60 MPH winds during the early evening.  The largest hail reported was 2 inches in diameter in Cincinnati in Appanoose County.  The storms produced copious rainfall in spite of their rapid movement.  Flash flooding was reported in Union, Adair, Davis, and Adams Counties.  For the most part the flash flooding was relatively minor, limited to water flowing rapidly over roads.  In Davis County at Bloomfield, water blew off manhole covers and was deep enough to nearly reach the tops of car roofs.  The thunderstorm winds caused widespread damage to trees and power lines.  A semi-truck was overturned on Highway 141 west of Woodward by the winds.  Another was overturned in Carroll County on U.S. highway 30.

279368,3/22/2011 22:38,54,MG,nan,"Low pressure formed to the west of Iowa and during the morning it was located over central Nebraska with a warm front extending east-southeast across southern Iowa.  The low advanced east during the day as the warm front moved little.  Initially, the airmass was capped by a strong elevated mixed layer.  During the late afternoon and early evening hours, a strong upper level short wave moved into the area.  Temperatures aloft fell rapidly, destabilizing the atmosphere.  Meanwhile, a strong low level jet formed ahead of the approaching low with winds of 40 to 50 kts.  This helped to bring in moisture and increased the precipitable water values to around an inch over much of Iowa.  By late afternoon, most unstable CAPE values were in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  Surface lifted indices were not all that impressive, however the elevated values were in the -3 to -6 C range.  The atmosphere was strongly sheared with 50 to 70 kts of available shear.  The LCL values were quite low as strong heating had not taken place during the day.  LCL heights were between 500 and 1000 meters.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high with values just ahead of the convection between 700 and 1000 J/kg.  The freezing level was quite low, near 11,000 feet, and available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 400 and 500 J/kg.  Thunderstorms fired along and just south of the surface low along a dry line ahead of the associated cold front.  Convection was strong and moved rapidly northeast.  There were two areas of thunderstorms.  A line of strong to severe thunderstorms formed just ahead of the cold front, with more isolated severe convection forming ahead of the main line.  There were numerous reports of tornadoes, mainly with the leading convection.  The three strongest tornadoes took place west to northwest of Creston in Union County, and northwest to north of Winterset in Madison County and southeast of Massena in Cass County.  The tornado in Cass County touched down approximately 1/2 mile east of the intersection of Iowa Hwy 148 and County Hwy G61. It damaged the canopy to an outdoor storage building and tipped over some industrial machinery. It continued northeast and damaged a structure...and caused some minor additional damage to a farmstead north of the intersection of County Hwy G61 and 760th St. Finally, it damaged some outdoor storage bins south of the intersection of County Hwy G53 and 770th Street.  It then lifted.  The same parent storm continued northeast and a small EF0 tornado touched down briefly near Bridgewater in Adair County.  In Madison County, A tornado touched down 10 miles northwest of Winterset. The tornado was characterized by a large circulation up to 0.8 tenths of a mile wide (Iowa Helicopter) and generally of EF1 (90-100 MPH wind) strength.   Eyewitnesses report the tornado was rain wrapped and difficult to distinguish from the rain shield as it approached them from the southwest. The tornado moved across several residences, many of which had broken windows and some roof damage along with significant tree and outbuilding damage. One newly constructed house that was near completion, slid off its foundation with the metal tie down straps either sheered off or pulled out of the concrete foundation. This damage is consistent with winds around 120 MPH which are EF2 strength. The roof structure remained intact and was aided by hurricane clips. Several other residences suffered partial roof removal with no hurricane clips noted. One other location had numerous trees either uprooted or topped and several outbuildings with the roofs blown off.  Objects near the ground did not suffer near as much damage suggesting the peak winds at this location were just off the surface. The tornado lifted around 10 miles north northeast of Winterset or 5 miles south of Van Meter around 1735 CST. The tornado in Union County was not as intense, with damage there relatively minor.  In addition to the line of severe thunderstorms, there was also convection that developed to the north of the low pressure track.  Outside of the tornadic storms, the primary mode of severe weather was hail.  There were reports of hail with most of the storms as they passed, with several reports of hail from quarter up to golf ball in size.  Hail caused damage to roofs and vehicles.  Fortunately, the crops had not been planted so there wasnt any agricultural loss.  A few reports of strong winds were received with wind gusts in the 60 to 65 MPH range.  Some tree and power line damage occurred, but it was not widespread.  Heavy rainfall caused minor flooding in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  A rainfall of 1.73 inches in under 2 hours in West Des Moines resulted in minor urban flooding along EP True Parkway.  Water was standing 1 to 2 feet deep in low drainage areas along the parkway.

In the wake of this system, hundreds of people were left injured and/or homeless, along with approximately 100 people who lost their lives in the northern Alabama area alone. Some of the devastation was literally unimaginable with countless homes, neighborhoods and even portions of cities or towns either partially or completely destroyed. This storm system would be responsible for one of the largest and deadliest tornado outbreaks to ever impact much of the southeastern region.   The powerful storm system that affected the National Weather Service, Huntsville service area would actually occur in three separate waves of severe weather that day. The first occurred during the early morning hours of April 27, 2011 roughly between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM CDT, while the second occurred during the late-morning to early afternoon period. The third and most devastating wave occurred during the afternoon hours on Wednesday, with some of the most violent and destructive tornadoes to affect the central Tennessee Valley area in recent decades.   The worst areas impacted by these storms included the towns of Phil Campbell and Oak Grove in eastern Franklin County Alabama, Mt. Hope in western Lawrence County and the Tanner Community in eastern Limestone County. Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.   Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County.

By the evening of Thursday, 1 September 2011, the tropical wave further developed into Tropical Depression 13. By 1 PM the following Friday afternoon, Tropical Depression Lee had formed. Lee slowly moved northward towards the south central Louisiana coastline by Saturday afternoon 3 September, while continuing to produce extremely heavy rainfall over portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the northwest Florida Panhandle.   The outer rain-bands of Lee produced near-continuous heavy rainfall over portions of southern Alabama, southeastern Mississippi and the northwestern Florida Panhandle by early Saturday morning and that endured through early Sunday before dry air aloft wrapped into Lee’s western side. The center of Lee moved over land around sunrise Sunday, 4 September. However, it would be a while before Lee would weaken to a depression because it remained nearly stationary while the southern half of the circulation was over water where it could continue to derive additional energy from the warm ocean. The next day, Lee was eventually picked up by an upper air trough, turned northeastward and resumed a faster forward speed late in the day on Sunday, 4 September as it began its welcome exit to the northeast late Sunday through late Monday.  Lee’s impacts were far reaching across our region. Although the continuous rains became somewhat intermittent as dry air wrapped into Lee from the west, this created a situation from Sunday afternoon through midday Monday whereby individual thunderstorms became more intense due to increasing levels of atmospheric instability.

At the surface, a fairly well-defined quasi-stationary front extended across the region from southeast Colorado to east-central Nebraska, with a few areas of low pressure along it. This surface front marked a sharp division in instability, with mid-day mixed-layer CAPE values ranging from negligible across western portions of South Central Nebraska, to between 1500-2500 J/kg in eastern counties. Deep layer vertical wind shear on the order of 30-50 knots was also present, making the environment conducive to fairly widespread severe storm development.  Focusing on storm mode and timing, the nearly solid line of severe storms lifted northeast across South Central Nebraska in a generally west-northwest to east-southeast orientation, first crossing into the state out of north central Kansas around 1 PM CDT, and eventually exiting the Polk and Nance County areas around 4 PM CDT. While strong to severe wind gusts of 50-70 MPH were common across several counties, the brief tornadoes were likely a result of the line of storms encountering enhanced low level shear and easterly low-level winds along and north of the quasi-stationary front.",41.18,-97.55

Thunderstorms formed in two complexes along a weak frontal boundary extending from Minnesota into Kansas.  One of the complexes pushed north and east out of Kansas and Nebraska, the second was over southern Minnesota.  The two filled in during the night as the whole system moved into richer air.  An outflow boundary was located across northern Iowa from the complex in Minnesota, enhancing convection there.  As the storms moved into Iowa, the primary threat came in the form of wind with wind gusts of 40 to 60 MPH associated with the fast moving forward propagating MCS.  Wind damage occurred in the Atlantic area with a tree blocking U.S. Highway 6.  This cluster of storms continued to move across the state at around 55 MPH.  Wind damage occurred in the Des Moines area with tree branches down and power line damage caused by 60 MPH winds.  A 59 MPH wind gust was recorded at the Ames Airport as the storms passed.  As the complex of storms continued east out of central Iowa, widespread damage occurred across Marshall and Tama Counties with winds of 70 to 100 MPH.  Two radio towers were downed, one in central Tama County, the other in northern Polk County.  A local television stations weather radar was destroyed near Alleman, also in Polk County.  Local wind speeds in these areas were estimated as high as 115 MPH.  Widespread power outages were reported with 90% of the power still out in Marshall County, and 75% out in Tama County 12 hours after the event.  Power was out for 3 to 4 days in some places.  Governor Terry Brandstad gave a State Disaster Proclamation to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties due the extensive damage.  A presidential declaration for major disaster was also given to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties.  A broad area of severe damage occurred with a path 5 miles wide of EF1 type damage caused by the high winds.  A path, 10 miles wide, of 70 to 80 MPH was surveyed, with a 15 to 20 mile wide path of wind speeds above 60 MPH.  The damage swath was nearly continuous with no evidence of tornadoes.  It extended from southern Story and northern Polk Counties, through Marshall, and Tama Counties, and was about 75 miles in length before exiting the CWA.  Crop losses were substantial with around 40% or greater loss on over 100,000 acres of corn and soy beans.  The corn had much more damage than the bean plants, with damage on these acres estimated at $95,000,000.  Other damage occurred around the area as well.  This derecho event was the most widespread one to affect central and east central Iowa since the June 1998 event.  Some examples of the notable wind speeds estimated from the survey include 96 MPH near Huxley, 94 MPH near Maxwell, 70 to 90 MPH near Marshalltown, 105 MPH east of Garwin, 85 to 97 MPH between Garwin and Union Grove State Park, 100 MPH south of Traer, and south to southwest of Dysart 105 to 115 MPH, with 80 to 100 MPH winds just south of that part of the swath.  One dairy farmer near Dysart reported the total loss of 300 acres of corn and $300,000 damage to the farm.  Several of his dairy cows perished or had to be euthanized.

A favorable setup for severe thunderstorm activity, developed in the mid-section of the country. Very warm and humid air lifted northward into the region, while cooler air lingered in the western Great Lakes. The battleground between these two types of air mass, established itself from Nebraska to western Iowa, northern Kansas, and northern Missouri.  Severe thunderstorms developed during the evening and overnight hours of Thursday August 18th and 19th, 2011.  Scattered supercell thunderstorms developed over eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, producing very large hail and heavy rain. While this soon to be large cluster of thunderstorms was beginning to develop over western Nebraska, an isolated supercell drifted towards the city of Maryville, Missouri.  As this storm rolled through the city,  winds greater than 80 mph even approaching 100 mph created extreme damage. This storm crushed numerous corn fields and produced extensive hail damage. Quickly filling in behind this supercell was the aforementioned developing mesoscale convective system, or MCS, capable of producing extreme winds. This system quickly became organized and pushed from north to south down the Missouri river. Winds were estimated between 60 and 80 mph, as damage was reported from St. Joseph to Leavenworth, and across the Kansas City metropolitan area. Extensive tree and powerline damage was reported, with upwards of 100,000 customers without power, at the height of the event.

344959,10/8/2011 5:15,55,MG,nan,"Ending a stretch of 2.5 weeks of bone-dry weather, and also ending a streak of nearly six weeks with no severe thunderstorms in the 24-county area, this Friday afternoon and evening featured a concentrated corridor of strong to severe storms and heavy rainfall mainly across western portions of South Central Nebraska. These storms forced delays or cancellations to a number of high school football games during what turned into a fairly prolonged event, with wind and hail-producing storms first flaring up around 230 PM CDT, and finally diminishing in intensity around 1 AM. The majority of severe storms and heavy rainfall regenerated for several hours within a narrow southwest-northeast oriented corridor only about 30 miles wide at most, primarily impacting counties such as Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo, Howard, Hall and northwest Adams. The storm mode was a mixed bag of quasi-discrete, fast moving supercells and small multicell bowing segments. Storm reports included several instances of damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of golf balls. A few of the more notable reports were from Atlanta in Phelps County, including golf ball size hail and significant wind damage to the roof of a grain storage building. At the Holdrege airport, two separate storms produced measured gusts to around 60 MPH, several hours apart from one another. Although a few storms exhibited low-level rotation, no tornadoes occurred.   Heavy rainfall-wise, parts of primarily eastern Furnas, northwest Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo and southeast Sherman Counties measured 3-6 inches of rain during this event, including 5.94 inches northwest of Oxford and 5.33 inches in Loomis. Kearney Regional Airport established a record for the date with 2.29 inches. Although the heaviest rain associated with this low pressure system fell during these storms on the afternoon and evening of the 7th, additional rain throughout the weekend boosted 3-day totals into the 6-7 inch range for some areas, highlighted by 7.13 inches at Loomis. Fortunately, due to the very dry conditions leading up to this event, widespread flooding impacts were held to a minimum.   On the synoptic scale, the primary trigger for severe weather was the approach of a highly amplified mid-level trough across the western United States, anchored by a closed low swinging through the Four Corners region. Downstream from this low, a corridor of strong, nearly unidirectional south-southwest winds was in place in the mid and upper levels. At the surface, storm development focused along a quasi-stationary front, which at mid-afternoon stretched from eastern South Dakota to southwest Kansas. Given that winds aloft were largely parallel to this southwest-northeast oriented surface front, convection was able to focus within the aforementioned narrow corridor, with individual storms within the corridor racing northeast. Mesoscale parameters at early evening revealed only modest instability, with mixed-layer CAPE values only around 1000 J/kg, but in the presence of very strong deep-layer vertical wind shear of 50-60 knots. Although low-level shear ramped up as the evening progressed, with 0-1 kilometer shear values increasing to 30-40 knots, the combination of increasing low level convective inhibition and multiple storm mergers likely helped mitigate a potential tornadic threat.",40.45,-99.33

By the evening of Thursday, 1 September 2011, the tropical wave further developed into Tropical Depression 13. By 1 PM the following Friday afternoon, Tropical Depression Lee had formed. Lee slowly moved northward towards the south central Louisiana coastline by Saturday afternoon 3 September, while continuing to produce extremely heavy rainfall over portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the northwest Florida Panhandle.   The outer rain-bands of Lee produced near-continuous heavy rainfall over portions of southern Alabama, southeastern Mississippi and the northwestern Florida Panhandle by early Saturday morning and that endured through early Sunday before dry air aloft wrapped into Lee’s western side. The center of Lee moved over land around sunrise Sunday, 4 September. However, it would be a while before Lee would weaken to a depression because it remained nearly stationary while the southern half of the circulation was over water where it could continue to derive additional energy from the warm ocean. The next day, Lee was eventually picked up by an upper air trough, turned northeastward and resumed a faster forward speed late in the day on Sunday, 4 September as it began its welcome exit to the northeast late Sunday through late Monday.  Lee’s impacts were far reaching across our region. Although the continuous rains became somewhat intermittent as dry air wrapped into Lee from the west, this created a situation from Sunday afternoon through midday Monday whereby individual thunderstorms became more intense due to increasing levels of atmospheric instability. Stronger thunderstorms and isolated tornadoes affected the North Central Gulf Coast Region, as they formed within the detached outer spiral rain-bands well to the east of Lee’s center on Sunday and finally to the southeast on Monday. The highest total storm tide levels (astronomical plus surge effects) ranged from approximately 3.5 to just barely over 5 feet.

Stronger thunderstorms and isolated tornadoes affected the North Central Gulf Coast Region, as they formed within the detached outer spiral rain-bands well to the east of Lee’s center on Sunday and finally to the southeast on Monday. The highest total storm tide levels (astronomical plus surge effects) ranged from approximately 3.5 to just barely over 5 feet.  While Lee was in the process of being picked up by a fast moving upper air trough, a series of squall lines that produced moderately widespread thunderstorm wind damage along and ahead of the surface cold front, as well as more isolated tornadoes, affected the area through late Monday afternoon. In all, some 10 to 15 inches of rain fell along coastal sections of Alabama and northwest Florida. Additionally, several weak tornadoes occurred producing modest structural and tree damage. There was also moderate beach erosion and the rip currents endured over a multi-day period. Inland flooding was exacerbated along the immediate coastal zone by higher tide levels due to Lee’s surge effects which created poor to no drainage of area coastal rivers, bays and sounds on during astronomical high tide cycles from 3-5 September (late night hours each day).",30.6834,-88.0334
349794,9/5/2011 16:31,56,MG,nan,"Tropical Storm Lee began as a tropical wave in the Caribbean Sea during the last week of August. By the evening of Thursday, 1 September 2011, the tropical wave further developed into Tropical Depression 13. By 1 PM the following Friday afternoon, Tropical Depression Lee had formed. Lee slowly moved northward towards the south central Louisiana coastline by Saturday afternoon 3 September, while continuing to produce extremely heavy rainfall over portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the northwest Florida Panhandle.   The outer rain-bands of Lee produced near-continuous heavy rainfall over portions of southern Alabama, southeastern Mississippi and the northwestern Florida Panhandle by early Saturday morning and that endured through early Sunday before dry air aloft wrapped into Lee’s western side. The center of Lee moved over land around sunrise Sunday, 4 September. However, it would be a while before Lee would weaken to a depression because it remained nearly stationary while the southern half of the circulation was over water where it could continue to derive additional energy from the warm ocean. The next day, Lee was eventually picked up by an upper air trough, turned northeastward and resumed a faster forward speed late in the day on Sunday, 4 September as it began its welcome exit to the northeast late Sunday through late Monday.

The low advanced east during the day as the warm front moved little.  Initially, the airmass was capped by a strong elevated mixed layer.  During the late afternoon and early evening hours, a strong upper level short wave moved into the area.  Temperatures aloft fell rapidly, destabilizing the atmosphere.  Meanwhile, a strong low level jet formed ahead of the approaching low with winds of 40 to 50 kts.  This helped to bring in moisture and increased the precipitable water values to around an inch over much of Iowa.  By late afternoon, most unstable CAPE values were in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  Surface lifted indices were not all that impressive, however the elevated values were in the -3 to -6 C range.  The atmosphere was strongly sheared with 50 to 70 kts of available shear.  The LCL values were quite low as strong heating had not taken place during the day.  LCL heights were between 500 and 1000 meters.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high with values just ahead of the convection between 700 and 1000 J/kg.  The freezing level was quite low, near 11,000 feet, and available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 400 and 500 J/kg.  Thunderstorms fired along and just south of the surface low along a dry line ahead of the associated cold front.  Convection was strong and moved rapidly northeast.  There were two areas of thunderstorms.  A line of strong to severe thunderstorms formed just ahead of the cold front, with more isolated severe convection forming ahead of the main line.  There were numerous reports of tornadoes, mainly with the leading convection.  The three strongest tornadoes took place west to northwest of Creston in Union County, and northwest to north of Winterset in Madison County and southeast of Massena in Cass County.  The tornado in Cass County touched down approximately 1/2 mile east of the intersection of Iowa Hwy 148 and County Hwy G61. It damaged the canopy to an outdoor storage building and tipped over some industrial machinery. It continued northeast and damaged a structure...and caused some minor additional damage to a farmstead north of the intersection of County Hwy G61 and 760th St. Finally, it damaged some outdoor storage bins south of the intersection of County Hwy G53 and 770th Street.  It then lifted.  The same parent storm continued northeast and a small EF0 tornado touched down briefly near Bridgewater in Adair County.  In Madison County, A tornado touched down 10 miles northwest of Winterset. The tornado was characterized by a large circulation up to 0.8 tenths of a mile wide (Iowa Helicopter) and generally of EF1 (90-100 MPH wind) strength.   Eyewitnesses report the tornado was rain wrapped and difficult to distinguish from the rain shield as it approached them from the southwest. The tornado moved across several residences, many of which had broken windows and some roof damage along with significant tree and outbuilding damage. One newly constructed house that was near completion, slid off its foundation with the metal tie down straps either sheered off or pulled out of the concrete foundation. This damage is consistent with winds around 120 MPH which are EF2 strength. The roof structure remained intact and was aided by hurricane clips. Several other residences suffered partial roof removal with no hurricane clips noted. One other location had numerous trees either uprooted or topped and several outbuildings with the roofs blown off.  Objects near the ground did not suffer near as much damage suggesting the peak winds at this location were just off the surface. The tornado lifted around 10 miles north northeast of Winterset or 5 miles south of Van Meter around 1735 CST. The tornado in Union County was not as intense, with damage there relatively minor.

Fortunately, the crops had not been planted so there wasnt any agricultural loss.  A few reports of strong winds were received with wind gusts in the 60 to 65 MPH range.  Some tree and power line damage occurred, but it was not widespread.  Heavy rainfall caused minor flooding in the metropolitan Des Moines area.

330853,7/11/2011 3:43,56,MG,nan,"The mid-to-late evening hours on this Sunday brought a rather widespread damaging wind event to the northwest half of South Central Nebraska, affecting locations mainly northwest of a line from Alma-Hastings-Osceola. The storm-mode featured a fast-moving, northeast-propagating linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that first entered Furnas County in the far southwest corner of the area around 8 PM CDT, and eventually exited far northeast counties such as Nance and Greeley between 1130 PM and midnight CDT. Over the course of these four hours, there were multiple reports of damaging winds in the 60-80 MPH range, but only few reports of large hail, highlighted by ping pong ball size stones near Holdrege. Measured wind gusts at airport sites included 68 MPH at Kearney and 64 MPH at Grand Island. Extensive tree damage was reported in several communities, including Edison, Kearney, Grand Island, Loup City, North Loup, Scotia and Greeley, just to name a few. In Grand Island, a 50-60 foot cottonwood tree narrowly missed a home as it fell, while on the west edge of Holdrege, an empty trailer home was blown over. In addition to tree and power line damage, considerable crop damage resulted across the area, primarily from green snap of rapidly growing corn. Due to the fast-moving nature of the primary squall line, rainfall amounts in most areas were no more than 0.50 to 1.50 inches.   The initial clusters of storms that eventually congealed into the northward-propagating MCS developed during the late afternoon and early evening hours across central and northwest Kansas, near a subtle east-west front and within a zone of steep low-level lapse rates. A very unstable airmass was poised north of this surface front, with dewpoints well into the 70s across nearly all of South Central Nebraska. Storms evolved into prolific wind-producers thanks to efficient cold pool generation, aided by the development of a modest 25-30 knot low-level jet focused near the Nebraska-Kansas border.  Mesoscale parameters during the early stages of the event featured high MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg, in the presence of at least 30 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear. Aloft, the synoptic pattern featured an expansive mid-level ridge across the southern states, and a broad trough across the northwest United States, with the local area positioned on the southern periphery of the stronger west-southwest flow between these two features.",40.97,-98.32
309120,7/11/2011 8:57,56,MG,nan,"A very unstable airmass was in place over Iowa with CAPE values around 6000 J/kg and lifted indices around -11 C.  The downdraft CAPE was 1500 to 1900 J/kg.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was high, in the 800 to 1200 J/kg range, however the freezing level was 15,500 feet, limiting the hail production.  The shear profile was relatively weak with 30 kts of effective shear available.  Predawn temperatures were in the upper 70s to around 80, with dewpoints in the mid 70s.  Precipitable water values were in the 1.5 to 2 inch range, boosted by a 35 kt low level jet.  Thunderstorms formed in two complexes along a weak frontal boundary extending from Minnesota into Kansas.  One of the complexes pushed north and east out of Kansas and Nebraska, the second was over southern Minnesota.  The two filled in during the night as the whole system moved into richer air.  An outflow boundary was located across northern Iowa from the complex in Minnesota, enhancing convection there.  As the storms moved into Iowa, the primary threat came in the form of wind with wind gusts of 40 to 60 MPH associated with the fast moving forward propagating MCS.  Wind damage occurred in the Atlantic area with a tree blocking U.S. Highway 6.  This cluster of storms continued to move across the state at around 55 MPH.  Wind damage occurred in the Des Moines area with tree branches down and power line damage caused by 60 MPH winds.  A 59 MPH wind gust was recorded at the Ames Airport as the storms passed.  As the complex of storms continued east out of central Iowa, widespread damage occurred across Marshall and Tama Counties with winds of 70 to 100 MPH.  Two radio towers were downed, one in central Tama County, the other in northern Polk County.  A local television stations weather radar was destroyed near Alleman, also in Polk County.  Local wind speeds in these areas were estimated as high as 115 MPH.  Widespread power outages were reported with 90% of the power still out in Marshall County, and 75% out in Tama County 12 hours after the event.  Power was out for 3 to 4 days in some places.  Governor Terry Brandstad gave a State Disaster Proclamation to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties due the extensive damage.  A presidential declaration for major disaster was also given to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties.  A broad area of severe damage occurred with a path 5 miles wide of EF1 type damage caused by the high winds.  A path, 10 miles wide, of 70 to 80 MPH was surveyed, with a 15 to 20 mile wide path of wind speeds above 60 MPH.  The damage swath was nearly continuous with no evidence of tornadoes.  It extended from southern Story and northern Polk Counties, through Marshall, and Tama Counties, and was about 75 miles in length before exiting the CWA.  Crop losses were substantial with around 40% or greater loss on over 100,000 acres of corn and soy beans.  The corn had much more damage than the bean plants, with damage on these acres estimated at $95,000,000.  Other damage occurred around the area as well.  This derecho event was the most widespread one to affect central and east central Iowa since the June 1998 event.  Some examples of the notable wind speeds estimated from the survey include 96 MPH near Huxley, 94 MPH near Maxwell, 70 to 90 MPH near Marshalltown, 105 MPH east of Garwin, 85 to 97 MPH between Garwin and Union Grove State Park, 100 MPH south of Traer, and south to southwest of Dysart 105 to 115 MPH, with 80 to 100 MPH winds just south of that part of the swath.  One dairy farmer near Dysart reported the total loss of 300 acres of corn and $300,000 damage to the farm.  Several of his dairy cows perished or had to be euthanized.  The farmer said he would have to go out of the farming business after 45 years due to the extent of the loss.  In Tama County, officials reported that 1000 county road signs were destroyed by the high wind.

The airmass became very unstable with the lifted index falling to around -8 and CAPE in excess of 4000 J/kg.  The atmosphere was quite warm with the freezing level between 15,000 and 16,000 feet.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was around 600 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high, in the 1200 to 1500 J/kg range.  Considerable shear was available with shear in the 50 to 65 kt range.  Meanwhile, a strong mid level trough of low pressure approached the central U.S. along with a moderate cold front approaching from the northwest.  During the night, the low level jet increased to 70 kts, further feeding the thunderstorms.  A large complex of thunderstorms developed across South Dakota into Nebraska.  It moved southeast into the rich air over Iowa and accelerated, becoming a derecho.  A large area of high winds developed with widespread wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH, mainly over the southwest half of the CWA.  The storms also produced hail at most locations as it passed.  Most of the hail was around an inch or so in diameter.  A smaller area of thunderstorms formed over southeast Iowa, ahead of the main area.  These storms produced hail up to golf ball in size, along with 60 MPH winds during the early evening.  The largest hail reported was 2 inches in diameter in Cincinnati in Appanoose County.  The storms produced copious rainfall in spite of their rapid movement.  Flash flooding was reported in Union, Adair, Davis, and Adams Counties.

However as the storm system approached, a surface low pressure area formed along the frontal boundary, which helped to draw warm and humid conditions northward into the Coastal Bend.   As the upper level storm system moved through the region, very strong wind shear developed and combined with an unstable atmosphere to produce a line of severe thunderstorms. A tornadic thunderstorm developed near the proximity of the surface low and retreating warm front, which persisted for over 20 miles travelling from just southeast of Alice to near Calallen. Damaging straight line winds affected most of the Coastal Bend and extended well into the Gulf of Mexico east of Rockport. Widespread wind damage was observed across the Coastal Bend as the storms moved quickly through the region. Approximately 30,000 customers lost power as a result of the storms. This marks the first time a tornado has been recorded in South Texas in the month of January, dating back to 1950. Property damage for the tornado and straight-line winds for the Coastal Bend was estimated to be around 10 million dollars.

Rapidly evolving from a multicell cluster to a brief high-precipitation supercell, this storm packed quite a punch, causing considerable wind damage in northern Jewell County as it pushed along the Kansas-Nebraska border mainly between 9 PM and 1030 PM CDT. Estimated winds of 60 to at least 80 MPH were reported, with a home weather station northeast of Webber measuring 67 MPH. The most substantial report of wind damage occurred in extreme northern Jewell County just 2 miles south of Superior, Nebraska, where a modular home was declared a total loss after having its roof and one wall blown off. The residents were un-injured. Extensive tree and crop damage occurred across near the state line as well. As the storm moved just east of the Webber and Superior area toward northwestern Republic County, it rapidly started to weaken and dissipate. Although additional thunderstorms rumbled across much of North Central Kansas well into the early morning hours on the 22nd, none of these became severe.   This storm rapidly intensified around 9 PM CDT, evolving from a weak and narrow line of convection that had been drifting east along the state line for a few hours. This area of convection was largely detached from more widespread multicell storm activity ongoing at least 50-80 miles to the south near Interstate 70. The rapid intensification into a supercell was likely due to a combination of factors, including the encountering of a more unstable and less-capped airmass in the vicinity of a surface warm front. Mesoscale severe weather parameters around this time featured only marginal deep-layer vertical wind shear around 30 knots, but significant mixed-layer CAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. Aloft, synoptic forcing was weak, with only subtle mid level disturbances passing through weak to modest quasi-zonal flow.

319831,8/7/2011 3:40,58,MG,Recorded from an Iowa Department of Transportation RWIS site.,"A cold front moved into Iowa from the northwest.  The airmass was quite unstable with CAPE values in the 4000-5000 J/kg range and lifted indices around -8 C.  Afternoon highs reached the upper 80s to low 90s, with dewpoints in the low to mid 70s ahead of the cold front.  Precipitable water was quite high with 1.6 to 2 inches available.  Scattered thunderstorms formed to the west of Iowa initially in a scattered line.  They coalesced into a small forward propagating MCS by the evening hours.  The airmass was moderately sheared with 40 to 45 kts of effective shear.  The freezing level was quite high, around 14,500 feet, so hail was limited.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 700 and 1100 J/kg.  The storms produced high winds as the primary mode of severe weather.  This was not too surprising considering there was 1500 J/kg of downdraft CAPE available just ahead of the MCS.  Initially the storms did produce hail as the cells were more discrete.  Dime to quarter size hail was reported in Crawford and Audubon Counties.  The system quickly became a wind event as it raced across the southern third to half of Iowa.  Winds speeds of 60 to 70 MPH were common along its path.  The highest measured wind gust was 71 MPH northwest of Creston.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed all along the path.  Damage was done to some house roofs in the town of Creston, with a tree reportedly falling onto one house in Creston.  Roof damage was also reported in Madison County with an American Legion building damaged in Macksburg.  High winds also blew a camper off of its jacks in Lucas County in Williamson.  High winds damaged outbuildings, peeling back roofs and blowing over sheds across Adair, Clarke, and Madison County.  High winds blew out a large window at a Walmart in Marion County in Knoxville.  During the early morning hours, strong thunderstorms developed over parts of northern Iowa, also along the front.  For the most part they remained below severe levels.  One of the storms produced 60 to 65 MPH winds in Franklin County at Hampton.  Numerous trees were downed and power was knocked out for much of the city.",41.05,-94.31

316942,5/31/2011 2:53,59,MG,Damage reports included 2 pivots overturned 6 miles south of Giltner and 4 to 6 inch tree limbs knocked down in Aurora.,"The evening hours of Memorial Day 2011 featured the most widespread damaging wind event of the spring severe weather season across South Central Nebraska, as a narrow, intense line of storms marched from west to east across the entire area. Along nearly the entire length of this north-south oriented squall line were estimated or measured wind gusts of 60-80 MPH, with automated equipment at the Lexington airport recording the highest-known measured gust of 90 MPH. As a result, widespread wind damage primarily to trees, power lines and outbuildings occurred across multiple counties. Although there several preliminary reports of brief tornadoes along the leading edge of the squall line, including one near Cozad early in the evening, radar data along with photographic and video evidence suggests that the vast majority of these reports were actually gustnadoes, which are brief, but sometimes strong circulations associated with outflow and not connected to cloud base rotation. Most of these gustnado reports focused west of the Highway 281 corridor. In addition, there were also sporadic reports of quarter size hail, but damaging straight-line wind along the surging outflow was the main story by far. Just to name a few, wind highlights included: a measured 74 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island with several reports of structural damage within the city including a destroyed mini-storage building; a measured gust to 83 MPH at the Ord airport with considerable damage to a hangar; three empty grain bins blown off their foundations and an unsecured trailer rolled near Strang in Fillmore County.   Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development took place across north central Nebraska during mid-afternoon, with the developing severe squall line first creeping southward into western Dawson County around 7 PM CDT. Thereafter, the line continued to build south into Kansas as it marched east, crossing the Highway 281 corridor mainly between 9 and 10 PM CDT, and finally exiting eastern portions of South Central Nebraska between 11 PM and midnight CDT.   The synoptic and mesoscale environment was certainly ripe for a damaging, linear wind event. Earlier in the day, a strong pressure gradient brought hours of sustained 30-40 MPH winds and frequent gusts of 45-55 MPH to South Central Nebraska, as a 994 millibar surface low pressure system organized near the Colorado-Kansas border. Aloft, a powerful, negatively tilted upper level trough centered across the Central and Northern Rockies gradually ejected northeast toward the Northern Plains, allowing considerable large scale forcing and increasing wind fields to overspread Nebraska, including 60-80 knot southwesterly flow at 500 millibars. Lower in the atmosphere, southerly low-level jet winds at 850 millibars increased to around 60 knots. At the surface, a pronounced cold front sliced through the area, providing sharp linear forcing for development of the squall line. Mesoscale severe weather parameters early in the evening included mixed layer CAPE values around 2500 J/kg, and deep-layer vertical wind shear generally 50-70 knots. As the evening wore on, 0-1 kilometer low-level bulk shear ramped up to notably strong values of 40-50 knots, providing a very favorable environment for damaging winds and gustnadoes.",40.6932,-98.15

330451,6/2/2011 6:29,59,MG,The Automated Weather Observing System at Moritz Memorial Airport measured a wind speed of 68 mph. There was widespread tree damage and power loss in the area.,"Less than 48 hours after a line of damaging winds marched across North Central Kansas, a significant episode of severe weather targeted the six-county area on this Wednesday afternoon and early Thursday morning in the vicinity of a surface warm front. There were numerous reports of hail to golf ball size or larger across the area, and a few instances of damaging winds up to around 75 MPH. A brief EF0 tornado also occurred in far northern Phillips County. In addition, these storms drenched much of the area with torrential rainfall, bringing yet another round of significant flooding. Duration-wise, this was one of the most prolific severe weather events of the 2011 season, with at least one convective warning, and sometimes several, in effect at any given time for nearly 10 straight hours from around 4 PM to 2 AM CDT. A few of the more notable severe weather reports included 2-inch diameter hail in the Stockton and Natoma areas, and several power poles downed southeast of Alton.   In terms of flooding, this was the third, and likely worst heavy rain event to strike this portion of North Central Kansas in a two-week span dating back to May 19th. Much of Smith, Jewell, Osborne and Mitchell Counties tallied 3-5 inches of rain. An observer at Ionia reported 4.59 inches from this event, bringing the total rainfall during the past nine days up to 9.57 inches. At one point in the evening, one foot of water was reported over Highway 14 in southern Mitchell County. Widespread rural flooding of creeks, streams and roads ensued as well, impacting various waterways including the Limestone, Oak and White Rock Creeks. Some evacuations were necessary northeast of Downs. Several main-stem rivers also went into flood, including the Solomon at Glen Elder and Beloit, North Fork Solomon at Portis, and South Fork Solomon at Woodston and Osborne. The gauges at Portis, Glen Elder and Beloit exceeded moderate flood stage, with Glen Elder cresting 5.76 feet over flood stage on the evening of the 2nd.   This event essentially consisted of multiple, splitting supercell storms developing and tracking through the same areas. The first supercells initiated just west of the area around 330 PM CDT, quickly became severe, and rolled into Rooks and Phillips Counties by 430 PM. Although the initial volley of severe storms started to exit southern portions of Osborne and Mitchell Counties around 9 PM, considerable redevelopment soon took place farther west along the nose of a strong low-level jet. As a result, a whole new round of severe storms traversed the area for several more hours before finally exiting east of Jewell and Mitchell Counties by 2 AM, but not before producing gusts to 68 MPH at the Beloit airport.   Although the mesoscale environment was supportive of severe weather, the long-lasting nature of this event was somewhat unexpected given a lack of large-scale forcing. The mid-levels featured only subtle, weak shortwave energy, well downstream from a powerful trough centered along the Pacific Northwest coast. However, deep-layer vertical wind shear around 40 knots, in combination with high mixed-layer CAPE values of 2500-4000 J/kg at the onset of the event made for a very conducive supercell environment. The primary instigator for multiple rounds of supercells was a persistent southerly low-level jet impinging over a surface warm front stretched from southwest Nebraska to east central Kansas. Winds along the nose of this jet at the 850-millibar level accelerated to 50 knots during the evening. This created very strong low-level wind shear and a mesoscale environment quite favorable for tornadoes. A review of radar data suggests that multiple storm-scale interactions, along with the outflow-dominant nature of some supercells likely spared North Central Kansas from a more significant tornado threat.",39.47,-98.13

330848,7/11/2011 2:55,59,MG,nan,"The mid-to-late evening hours on this Sunday brought a rather widespread damaging wind event to the northwest half of South Central Nebraska, affecting locations mainly northwest of a line from Alma-Hastings-Osceola. The storm-mode featured a fast-moving, northeast-propagating linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that first entered Furnas County in the far southwest corner of the area around 8 PM CDT, and eventually exited far northeast counties such as Nance and Greeley between 1130 PM and midnight CDT. Over the course of these four hours, there were multiple reports of damaging winds in the 60-80 MPH range, but only few reports of large hail, highlighted by ping pong ball size stones near Holdrege. Measured wind gusts at airport sites included 68 MPH at Kearney and 64 MPH at Grand Island. Extensive tree damage was reported in several communities, including Edison, Kearney, Grand Island, Loup City, North Loup, Scotia and Greeley, just to name a few. In Grand Island, a 50-60 foot cottonwood tree narrowly missed a home as it fell, while on the west edge of Holdrege, an empty trailer home was blown over. In addition to tree and power line damage, considerable crop damage resulted across the area, primarily from green snap of rapidly growing corn. Due to the fast-moving nature of the primary squall line, rainfall amounts in most areas were no more than 0.50 to 1.50 inches.   The initial clusters of storms that eventually congealed into the northward-propagating MCS developed during the late afternoon and early evening hours across central and northwest Kansas, near a subtle east-west front and within a zone of steep low-level lapse rates. A very unstable airmass was poised north of this surface front, with dewpoints well into the 70s across nearly all of South Central Nebraska. Storms evolved into prolific wind-producers thanks to efficient cold pool generation, aided by the development of a modest 25-30 knot low-level jet focused near the Nebraska-Kansas border.  Mesoscale parameters during the early stages of the event featured high MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg, in the presence of at least 30 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear.

However as the storm system approached, a surface low pressure area formed along the frontal boundary, which helped to draw warm and humid conditions northward into the Coastal Bend.   As the upper level storm system moved through the region, very strong wind shear developed and combined with an unstable atmosphere to produce a line of severe thunderstorms. A tornadic thunderstorm developed near the proximity of the surface low and retreating warm front, which persisted for over 20 miles travelling from just southeast of Alice to near Calallen. Damaging straight line winds affected most of the Coastal Bend and extended well into the Gulf of Mexico east of Rockport. Widespread wind damage was observed across the Coastal Bend as the storms moved quickly through the region. Approximately 30,000 customers lost power as a result of the storms. This marks the first time a tornado has been recorded in South Texas in the month of January, dating back to 1950. Property damage for the tornado and straight-line winds for the Coastal Bend was estimated to be around 10 million dollars.    From Calallen through Portland and Rockport, doppler radar indicated a broad, yet strong rotation between 4 and 430 AM CST. A NWS storm survey concluded straight-line winds between 70 and 90 mph occurred along this path.

Other measured wind gusts included 69 MPH at the Smith Center airport, and 58 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport. Although specific reports of damage were limited, there was likely at least minor tree and power line damage in parts of the area. Along with the winds, there were also a few reports of quarter size hail.    Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development along the squall line took place to the north across central and south central Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours.

Aloft, a powerful, negatively tilted upper level trough centered across the Central and Northern Rockies gradually ejected northeast toward the Northern Plains, allowing considerable large scale forcing and increasing wind fields to overspread northern Kansas, including 60-70 knot southwesterly flow at 500 millibars. Lower in the atmosphere, southerly low-level jet winds at 850 millibars increased to around 60 knots. At the surface, a pronounced cold front sliced through the area, providing sharp linear forcing for development of the squall line. Mesoscale severe weather parameters at mid-evening included mixed layer CAPE values around 2500 J/kg, and deep-layer vertical wind shear of at least 40-60 knots.

Shortly after 7 pm, a wet downburst caused intense rainfall and was accompanied by hail up to golf-ball size and winds that were measured at over 80 mph. Damage was reported over much of Norman, with the most intense damage occurring over the northern half of the city. Almost 33,000 residents were without power, some still without power over 24 hours later. This was due to the numerous power poles/lines that were snapped or blown down. The hail was blown almost horizontally, damaging siding, shattering store signs, and denting automobiles. The highest measured wind gust occurred near SE 12th and Boyd, where the anemometer recorded 82 mph before it malfunctioned due to the wind blown hail.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.  The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.  By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on “classic” supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.  Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.",33.4885,-90.085

One cyclic supercell associated with the system produced a very large and deadly EF-5 tornado that hit the city of Joplin and then spawned two separate tornadoes that moved across southwestern Missouri. A separate tornadic supercell produced an EF-3 tornado that moved into McDonald County from Northeastern Oklahoma.   Continuing thunderstorms lasted into May 23 as another line of thunderstorms moved across the region. This line of storms produced reports of large hail, damaging winds and a weak EF-0 tornado in south central Missouri. As the storms moved over the Joplin area, two police officers were struck by lightning while aiding in the post tornado efforts. One of the two officers later died of injuries from the lightning strike.",36.87,-93.54

316967,5/31/2011 3:37,63,MG,Wind gust was measured from a home weather station.,"The mid-to-late evening hours of Memorial Day 2011 brought a fairly widespread round of strong to severe winds to much of North Central Kansas, as a narrow, intense line of storms marched from west to east across the majority of the six-county area.  Along nearly the entire length of this northeast-southwest oriented squall line were estimated or measured wind gusts of 60-70 MPH, with a home weather station near Webber in Jewell County recording the highest known measured gust of 72 MPH. Other measured wind gusts included 69 MPH at the Smith Center airport, and 58 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport. Although specific reports of damage were limited, there was likely at least minor tree and power line damage in parts of the area. Along with the winds, there were also a few reports of quarter size hail.    Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development along the squall line took place to the north across central and south central Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The line of storms eventually built south into Kansas as it moved east, first affecting Phillips and Rooks Counties between 8 and 9 PM CDT, and eventually exiting Jewell and Mitchell Counties between 1130 PM and 1230 AM CDT.   The synoptic and mesoscale environment was certainly ripe for a damaging, linear wind event. Earlier in the day, a strong pressure gradient brought hours of sustained 30-40 MPH winds and frequent gusts of 45-50 MPH to North Central Kansas, as a 994 millibar surface low pressure system organized near the Colorado-Kansas border. Aloft, a powerful, negatively tilted upper level trough centered across the Central and Northern Rockies gradually ejected northeast toward the Northern Plains, allowing considerable large scale forcing and increasing wind fields to overspread northern Kansas, including 60-70 knot southwesterly flow at 500 millibars. Lower in the atmosphere, southerly low-level jet winds at 850 millibars increased to around 60 knots. At the surface, a pronounced cold front sliced through the area, providing sharp linear forcing for development of the squall line. Mesoscale severe weather parameters at mid-evening included mixed layer CAPE values around 2500 J/kg, and deep-layer vertical wind shear of at least 40-60 knots. As the evening wore on, 0-1 kilometer low-level bulk shear ramped up to notably strong values of 40-50 knots, providing a very favorable environment for damaging winds.",39.9411,-97.9951

The airmass became very unstable with the lifted index falling to around -8 and CAPE in excess of 4000 J/kg.  The atmosphere was quite warm with the freezing level between 15,000 and 16,000 feet.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was around 600 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high, in the 1200 to 1500 J/kg range.  Considerable shear was available with shear in the 50 to 65 kt range.  Meanwhile, a strong mid level trough of low pressure approached the central U.S. along with a moderate cold front approaching from the northwest.  During the night, the low level jet increased to 70 kts, further feeding the thunderstorms.  A large complex of thunderstorms developed across South Dakota into Nebraska.  It moved southeast into the rich air over Iowa and accelerated, becoming a derecho.  A large area of high winds developed with widespread wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH, mainly over the southwest half of the CWA.  The storms also produced hail at most locations as it passed.  Most of the hail was around an inch or so in diameter.  A smaller area of thunderstorms formed over southeast Iowa, ahead of the main area.  These storms produced hail up to golf ball in size, along with 60 MPH winds during the early evening.  The largest hail reported was 2 inches in diameter in Cincinnati in Appanoose County.  The storms produced copious rainfall in spite of their rapid movement.  Flash flooding was reported in Union, Adair, Davis, and Adams Counties.  For the most part the flash flooding was relatively minor, limited to water flowing rapidly over roads.  In Davis County at Bloomfield, water blew off manhole covers and was deep enough to nearly reach the tops of car roofs.  The thunderstorm winds caused widespread damage to trees and power lines.  A semi-truck was overturned on Highway 141 west of Woodward by the winds.  Another was overturned in Carroll County on U.S. highway 30.  A high wind event also took place with the storm complex as a wake low formed.  Strong easterly winds developed with wind speeds in the 60 to 75 MPH range common.  The strongest winds occurred in Webster County at Callendar.  Winds of 80 to 90 MPH blew down mailbox posts, blew down trees onto houses, and picked up a swing set and blew it through the window of a house.  Tree and power line damage was quite widespread over a 7 county area.  One tornado touched down in Carroll County south of Halbur.  A narrow swath of damage occurred from about one quarter mile south of the intersection of Granite Ave and County Road E53, with the roof blown off a hog confinement building just southeast of the intersection.

Although there several preliminary reports of brief tornadoes along the leading edge of the squall line, including one near Cozad early in the evening, radar data along with photographic and video evidence suggests that the vast majority of these reports were actually gustnadoes, which are brief, but sometimes strong circulations associated with outflow and not connected to cloud base rotation. Most of these gustnado reports focused west of the Highway 281 corridor. In addition, there were also sporadic reports of quarter size hail, but damaging straight-line wind along the surging outflow was the main story by far. Just to name a few, wind highlights included: a measured 74 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island with several reports of structural damage within the city including a destroyed mini-storage building; a measured gust to 83 MPH at the Ord airport with considerable damage to a hangar; three empty grain bins blown off their foundations and an unsecured trailer rolled near Strang in Fillmore County.   Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development took place across north central Nebraska during mid-afternoon, with the developing severe squall line first creeping southward into western Dawson County around 7 PM CDT. Thereafter, the line continued to build south into Kansas as it marched east, crossing the Highway 281 corridor mainly between 9 and 10 PM CDT, and finally exiting eastern portions of South Central Nebraska between 11 PM and midnight CDT.   The synoptic and mesoscale environment was certainly ripe for a damaging, linear wind event. Earlier in the day, a strong pressure gradient brought hours of sustained 30-40 MPH winds and frequent gusts of 45-55 MPH to South Central Nebraska, as a 994 millibar surface low pressure system organized near the Colorado-Kansas border. Aloft, a powerful, negatively tilted upper level trough centered across the Central and Northern Rockies gradually ejected northeast toward the Northern Plains, allowing considerable large scale forcing and increasing wind fields to overspread Nebraska, including 60-80 knot southwesterly flow at 500 millibars. Lower in the atmosphere, southerly low-level jet winds at 850 millibars increased to around 60 knots. At the surface, a pronounced cold front sliced through the area, providing sharp linear forcing for development of the squall line. Mesoscale severe weather parameters early in the evening included mixed layer CAPE values around 2500 J/kg, and deep-layer vertical wind shear generally 50-70 knots. As the evening wore on, 0-1 kilometer low-level bulk shear ramped up to notably strong values of 40-50 knots, providing a very favorable environment for damaging winds and gustnadoes.",40.97,-98.32

The airmass became very unstable with the lifted index falling to around -8 and CAPE in excess of 4000 J/kg.  The atmosphere was quite warm with the freezing level between 15,000 and 16,000 feet.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was around 600 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high, in the 1200 to 1500 J/kg range.  Considerable shear was available with shear in the 50 to 65 kt range.  Meanwhile, a strong mid level trough of low pressure approached the central U.S. along with a moderate cold front approaching from the northwest.  During the night, the low level jet increased to 70 kts, further feeding the thunderstorms.  A large complex of thunderstorms developed across South Dakota into Nebraska.  It moved southeast into the rich air over Iowa and accelerated, becoming a derecho.  A large area of high winds developed with widespread wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH, mainly over the southwest half of the CWA.  The storms also produced hail at most locations as it passed.  Most of the hail was around an inch or so in diameter.  A smaller area of thunderstorms formed over southeast Iowa, ahead of the main area.  These storms produced hail up to golf ball in size, along with 60 MPH winds during the early evening.  The largest hail reported was 2 inches in diameter in Cincinnati in Appanoose County.  The storms produced copious rainfall in spite of their rapid movement.  Flash flooding was reported in Union, Adair, Davis, and Adams Counties.  For the most part the flash flooding was relatively minor, limited to water flowing rapidly over roads.  In Davis County at Bloomfield, water blew off manhole covers and was deep enough to nearly reach the tops of car roofs.  The thunderstorm winds caused widespread damage to trees and power lines.  A semi-truck was overturned on Highway 141 west of Woodward by the winds.  Another was overturned in Carroll County on U.S. highway 30.  A high wind event also took place with the storm complex as a wake low formed.  Strong easterly winds developed with wind speeds in the 60 to 75 MPH range common.  The strongest winds occurred in Webster County at Callendar.  Winds of 80 to 90 MPH blew down mailbox posts, blew down trees onto houses, and picked up a swing set and blew it through the window of a house.  Tree and power line damage was quite widespread over a 7 county area.  One tornado touched down in Carroll County south of Halbur.  A narrow swath of damage occurred from about one quarter mile south of the intersection of Granite Ave and County Road E53, with the roof blown off a hog confinement building just southeast of the intersection.

The downdraft CAPE was 1500 to 1900 J/kg.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was high, in the 800 to 1200 J/kg range, however the freezing level was 15,500 feet, limiting the hail production.  The shear profile was relatively weak with 30 kts of effective shear available.  Predawn temperatures were in the upper 70s to around 80, with dewpoints in the mid 70s.  Precipitable water values were in the 1.5 to 2 inch range, boosted by a 35 kt low level jet.  Thunderstorms formed in two complexes along a weak frontal boundary extending from Minnesota into Kansas.  One of the complexes pushed north and east out of Kansas and Nebraska, the second was over southern Minnesota.  The two filled in during the night as the whole system moved into richer air.  An outflow boundary was located across northern Iowa from the complex in Minnesota, enhancing convection there.  As the storms moved into Iowa, the primary threat came in the form of wind with wind gusts of 40 to 60 MPH associated with the fast moving forward propagating MCS.  Wind damage occurred in the Atlantic area with a tree blocking U.S. Highway 6.  This cluster of storms continued to move across the state at around 55 MPH.  Wind damage occurred in the Des Moines area with tree branches down and power line damage caused by 60 MPH winds.  A 59 MPH wind gust was recorded at the Ames Airport as the storms passed.  As the complex of storms continued east out of central Iowa, widespread damage occurred across Marshall and Tama Counties with winds of 70 to 100 MPH.  Two radio towers were downed, one in central Tama County, the other in northern Polk County.  A local television stations weather radar was destroyed near Alleman, also in Polk County.  Local wind speeds in these areas were estimated as high as 115 MPH.  Widespread power outages were reported with 90% of the power still out in Marshall County, and 75% out in Tama County 12 hours after the event.  Power was out for 3 to 4 days in some places.  Governor Terry Brandstad gave a State Disaster Proclamation to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties due the extensive damage.  A presidential declaration for major disaster was also given to Story, Marshall, and Tama Counties.  A broad area of severe damage occurred with a path 5 miles wide of EF1 type damage caused by the high winds.  A path, 10 miles wide, of 70 to 80 MPH was surveyed, with a 15 to 20 mile wide path of wind speeds above 60 MPH.  The damage swath was nearly continuous with no evidence of tornadoes.  It extended from southern Story and northern Polk Counties, through Marshall, and Tama Counties, and was about 75 miles in length before exiting the CWA.  Crop losses were substantial with around 40% or greater loss on over 100,000 acres of corn and soy beans.  The corn had much more damage than the bean plants, with damage on these acres estimated at $95,000,000.  Other damage occurred around the area as well.  This derecho event was the most widespread one to affect central and east central Iowa since the June 1998 event.  Some examples of the notable wind speeds estimated from the survey include 96 MPH near Huxley, 94 MPH near Maxwell, 70 to 90 MPH near Marshalltown, 105 MPH east of Garwin, 85 to 97 MPH between Garwin and Union Grove State Park, 100 MPH south of Traer, and south to southwest of Dysart 105 to 115 MPH, with 80 to 100 MPH winds just south of that part of the swath.  One dairy farmer near Dysart reported the total loss of 300 acres of corn and $300,000 damage to the farm.  Several of his dairy cows perished or had to be euthanized.  The farmer said he would have to go out of the farming business after 45 years due to the extent of the loss.  In Tama County, officials reported that 1000 county road signs were destroyed by the high wind.

Although storm and damage reports were limited, the Phillipsburg airport measured a peak gust of 81 MPH, and gusts were estimated at 70 MPH near Cedar in Smith County. Even as the main core of strong to severe storms started pushing north into southern Nebraska, outflow winds to around 55 MPH were reported as far northeast as Burr Oak.

The gust occurred near 12th Avenue and Boyd Street.,"A cold front made its way southeast through Oklahoma during the day, lying over the northwest half of the state by late afternoon. A humid airmass was in place, with plenty of instability from which thunderstorms could work with. Temperatures ahead of the front were well into the 90s to a few degrees above 100 degrees. The large surface temperature and dew point spreads at the surface made the downburst wind threat very high. Also, with the aide of a stronger mid-level flow and cooling, large hail was also a threat. Thunderstorms developed over southwest Oklahoma by late afternoon/early evening. Other thunderstorms began developing over central Oklahoma. The two areas of thunderstorms merged into a line of severe storms, and even extended a little further northeast, with large hail and damaging winds reported through almost the entire complex. The most damaging storm occurred over central Oklahoma, specifically near Norman and Oklahoma City. Shortly after 7 pm, a wet downburst caused intense rainfall and was accompanied by hail up to golf-ball size and winds that were measured at over 80 mph. Damage was reported over much of Norman, with the most intense damage occurring over the northern half of the city. Almost 33,000 residents were without power, some still without power over 24 hours later. This was due to the numerous power poles/lines that were snapped or blown down. The hail was blown almost horizontally, damaging siding, shattering store signs, and denting automobiles. The highest measured wind gust occurred near SE 12th and Boyd, where the anemometer recorded 82 mph before it malfunctioned due to the wind blown hail. The Norman mesonet site measured a gust of 70 mph. A quick inch of rain occurred in about 15 to 20 minutes.

At the Ord Airport, the roof was peeled off of one of the hangars, and one side of the building was ripped away.","The evening hours of Memorial Day 2011 featured the most widespread damaging wind event of the spring severe weather season across South Central Nebraska, as a narrow, intense line of storms marched from west to east across the entire area. Along nearly the entire length of this north-south oriented squall line were estimated or measured wind gusts of 60-80 MPH, with automated equipment at the Lexington airport recording the highest-known measured gust of 90 MPH. As a result, widespread wind damage primarily to trees, power lines and outbuildings occurred across multiple counties. Although there several preliminary reports of brief tornadoes along the leading edge of the squall line, including one near Cozad early in the evening, radar data along with photographic and video evidence suggests that the vast majority of these reports were actually gustnadoes, which are brief, but sometimes strong circulations associated with outflow and not connected to cloud base rotation. Most of these gustnado reports focused west of the Highway 281 corridor. In addition, there were also sporadic reports of quarter size hail, but damaging straight-line wind along the surging outflow was the main story by far. Just to name a few, wind highlights included: a measured 74 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island with several reports of structural damage within the city including a destroyed mini-storage building; a measured gust to 83 MPH at the Ord airport with considerable damage to a hangar; three empty grain bins blown off their foundations and an unsecured trailer rolled near Strang in Fillmore County.   Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development took place across north central Nebraska during mid-afternoon, with the developing severe squall line first creeping southward into western Dawson County around 7 PM CDT. Thereafter, the line continued to build south into Kansas as it marched east, crossing the Highway 281 corridor mainly between 9 and 10 PM CDT, and finally exiting eastern portions of South Central Nebraska between 11 PM and midnight CDT.   The synoptic and mesoscale environment was certainly ripe for a damaging, linear wind event. Earlier in the day, a strong pressure gradient brought hours of sustained 30-40 MPH winds and frequent gusts of 45-55 MPH to South Central Nebraska, as a 994 millibar surface low pressure system organized near the Colorado-Kansas border. Aloft, a powerful, negatively tilted upper level trough centered across the Central and Northern Rockies gradually ejected northeast toward the Northern Plains, allowing considerable large scale forcing and increasing wind fields to overspread Nebraska, including 60-80 knot southwesterly flow at 500 millibars. Lower in the atmosphere, southerly low-level jet winds at 850 millibars increased to around 60 knots. At the surface, a pronounced cold front sliced through the area, providing sharp linear forcing for development of the squall line. Mesoscale severe weather parameters early in the evening included mixed layer CAPE values around 2500 J/kg, and deep-layer vertical wind shear generally 50-70 knots. As the evening wore on, 0-1 kilometer low-level bulk shear ramped up to notably strong values of 40-50 knots, providing a very favorable environment for damaging winds and gustnadoes.",41.6,-99.1235

Monetary damage estimates were not available.","A cold front made its way southeast through Oklahoma during the day, lying over the northwest half of the state by late afternoon. A humid airmass was in place, with plenty of instability from which thunderstorms could work with. Temperatures ahead of the front were well into the 90s to a few degrees above 100 degrees. The large surface temperature and dew point spreads at the surface made the downburst wind threat very high. Also, with the aide of a stronger mid-level flow and cooling, large hail was also a threat. Thunderstorms developed over southwest Oklahoma by late afternoon/early evening. Other thunderstorms began developing over central Oklahoma. The two areas of thunderstorms merged into a line of severe storms, and even extended a little further northeast, with large hail and damaging winds reported through almost the entire complex. The most damaging storm occurred over central Oklahoma, specifically near Norman and Oklahoma City. Shortly after 7 pm, a wet downburst caused intense rainfall and was accompanied by hail up to golf-ball size and winds that were measured at over 80 mph. Damage was reported over much of Norman, with the most intense damage occurring over the northern half of the city. Almost 33,000 residents were without power, some still without power over 24 hours later. This was due to the numerous power poles/lines that were snapped or blown down. The hail was blown almost horizontally, damaging siding, shattering store signs, and denting automobiles. The highest measured wind gust occurred near SE 12th and Boyd, where the anemometer recorded 82 mph before it malfunctioned due to the wind blown hail. The Norman mesonet site measured a gust of 70 mph. A quick inch of rain occurred in about 15 to 20 minutes.

300711,4/11/2011 6:51,78,MG,A mobile storm spotter measured a 90 mph wind gust approximately 5 miles north of Waxahachie.,A strong upper level low pressure system over the southern Rockies aided in the late evening development of severe thunderstorms along a dryline across north central and central Texas.  One of these storms was a strong linear mesoscale convective system which produced a swath of wind damage from Goldthwaite northeast into southern portions of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and continued northeast to near Sulphur Springs.  A swath of wind damage consistent with 70 to 80 mph winds was associated with this storm.  Other supercell thunderstorms in the area produced brief tornadoes and large hail.,32.47,-96.85
316863,5/31/2011 0:55,78,MG,"Wind gusts up to 90 MPH caused tree damage, knocked down power lines and overturned pivots in the area.  On the north side of Lexington, a fence at a ballfield was damaged.","The evening hours of Memorial Day 2011 featured the most widespread damaging wind event of the spring severe weather season across South Central Nebraska, as a narrow, intense line of storms marched from west to east across the entire area. Along nearly the entire length of this north-south oriented squall line were estimated or measured wind gusts of 60-80 MPH, with automated equipment at the Lexington airport recording the highest-known measured gust of 90 MPH. As a result, widespread wind damage primarily to trees, power lines and outbuildings occurred across multiple counties. Although there several preliminary reports of brief tornadoes along the leading edge of the squall line, including one near Cozad early in the evening, radar data along with photographic and video evidence suggests that the vast majority of these reports were actually gustnadoes, which are brief, but sometimes strong circulations associated with outflow and not connected to cloud base rotation. Most of these gustnado reports focused west of the Highway 281 corridor. In addition, there were also sporadic reports of quarter size hail, but damaging straight-line wind along the surging outflow was the main story by far. Just to name a few, wind highlights included: a measured 74 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island with several reports of structural damage within the city including a destroyed mini-storage building; a measured gust to 83 MPH at the Ord airport with considerable damage to a hangar; three empty grain bins blown off their foundations and an unsecured trailer rolled near Strang in Fillmore County.   Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development took place across north central Nebraska during mid-afternoon, with the developing severe squall line first creeping southward into western Dawson County around 7 PM CDT. Thereafter, the line continued to build south into Kansas as it marched east, crossing the Highway 281 corridor mainly between 9 and 10 PM CDT, and finally exiting eastern portions of South Central Nebraska between 11 PM and midnight CDT.   The synoptic and mesoscale environment was certainly ripe for a damaging, linear wind event. Earlier in the day, a strong pressure gradient brought hours of sustained 30-40 MPH winds and frequent gusts of 45-55 MPH to South Central Nebraska, as a 994 millibar surface low pressure system organized near the Colorado-Kansas border. Aloft, a powerful, negatively tilted upper level trough centered across the Central and Northern Rockies gradually ejected northeast toward the Northern Plains, allowing considerable large scale forcing and increasing wind fields to overspread Nebraska, including 60-80 knot southwesterly flow at 500 millibars. Lower in the atmosphere, southerly low-level jet winds at 850 millibars increased to around 60 knots. At the surface, a pronounced cold front sliced through the area, providing sharp linear forcing for development of the squall line. Mesoscale severe weather parameters early in the evening included mixed layer CAPE values around 2500 J/kg, and deep-layer vertical wind shear generally 50-70 knots. As the evening wore on, 0-1 kilometer low-level bulk shear ramped up to notably strong values of 40-50 knots, providing a very favorable environment for damaging winds and gustnadoes.",40.78,-99.77

This pattern kept a southerly flow aloft over the central California interior, bringing more monsoonal moisture into the region.  Thunderstorms developed over the Southern Sierra Nevada on August 24th, producing numerous lightning strikes but little rainfall.  The upper-level ridge core began to shift westward from the Desert Southwest, bringing an increase in temperatures and moisture to move into interior central California by the 26th.
