Although damage was not overly significant and storm reports were limited, automated airport sensors in or near Phillipsburg, Stockton, Smith Center and Beloit measured peak gusts between 58-63 MPH. In addition, a patio roof was torn off in Logan. Hail was not a major issue with these storms, with the largest reported hail only penny size in Burr Oak. Rainfall-wise, much of the area tallied over 1 inch but the highest totals in excess of 3 inches focused across parts of Jewell and Mitchell Counties, including 3.37 inches at Burr Oak. Despite this heavy rain, there were no reports of significant flooding.   Breaking down event timing, the initial development between 6 PM and 730 PM CDT occurred in two separate areas, with one storm cluster pushing in from the west across Phillips, Rooks and Smith Counties, while other storms built south into Jewell County out of Nebraska. Then between 730 and 9 PM CDT, these separate clusters merged into a nearly solid line, with the main part of the line exiting the local area out of Osborne and Mitchell Counties by 930 PM CDT.  Although additional storms lingered over parts of the area past midnight CDT, none were severe. These North Central Kansas storms evolved out of earlier severe storms that developed across southern Nebraska during the afternoon hours along a slow-moving cold front. In the mid and upper levels, synoptic scale forcing was relatively weak, with the area positioned well south of a stronger shortwave trough swinging across southern Canada and the Dakotas. However, with surface dewpoints averaging well into the 60s F, convective instability was quite high with early evening mixed-layer CAPE climbing to at least 2000-3000 J/kg. On the other hand, 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear was fairly weak at only around 30 knots, which allowed initially slow-moving storms to congeal into a line and surge southeast along strong outflow.

Although several wind gusts just shy of 58 mph were measured by various Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet sites across the western South Plains, a few winds gusts as high as 65 mph did eventually occur later in the evening. These winds created a large dustfoot along the length of the gust front that reduced visibilities in most areas to a few miles, with isolated instances of near zero visibilities downwind of cotton fields near Wolfforth.  As the squall line entered southwest Lubbock County, an east-west oriented line of storms intersected the line and resulted in one intense storm that produced localized large hail. Of greater significance was the torrential rainfall rates up to 3.5 inches per hour over much of the city of Lubbock. Widespread rainfall totals in this area of over one inch in a short period of time resulted in widespread street flooding.  By late this night, the 140 mile-long squall line began dissipating near the Caprock Escarpment.

423349,12/14/2012 21:29,51,MG,The KVII schoolnet mesonet two miles to the east-southeast of Wildorado recorded a thunderstorm winds gust of 59 mph.,"An anomalously dynamic upper level system caused a rare severe weather outbreak during the afternoon and evening hours of December 14th. This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front.   Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.     As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads.   Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot’s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).  As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0.   By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.",35.21,-102.21

423339,12/14/2012 22:02,52,MG,The West Texas Mesonet site in Palo Duro Canyon recorded a thunderstorm wind gust of 60 mph.,"An anomalously dynamic upper level system caused a rare severe weather outbreak during the afternoon and evening hours of December 14th. This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front.   Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.     As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads.   Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot’s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).  As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0.   By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.",34.99,-101.69

364379,3/19/2012 6:25,52,MG,Measured by the Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site near Turkey.,"Two separate rounds of severe thunderstorms developed the afternoon and evening of the 18th ahead of a vigorous upper level trough. By mid-afternoon, a dryline ignited widely scattered supercell thunderstorms from near Childress south to near Aspermont.  Marginally severe hail was common with these supercells. One storm south of Guthrie produced a funnel cloud observed by storm chasers. As the dryline retreated early in the evening, a left-moving supercell organized in northwest Garza County and raced north-northeast at highway speeds for the next 2.5 hours accompanied by large hail up to golfball size and severe winds.  A second and more extensive round of thunderstorms emerged late on the 18th across the southwest South Plains as a Pacific cold front collided with the retreating dryline.  The result was an extensive squall line that at one point extended from the Oklahoma Panhandle south to the western Permian Basin. Strong low-level shear in the vicinity of this squall line resulted in the formation of at least three persistent, non-tornadic circulations as observed by the NWS-LBB WSR-88D. One of these circulations was sampled in high detail by research meteorologists from Texas Tech University near Reese Center using mobile Doppler radars and high resolution surface stations (sticknets). The mobile data collected suggests these vorticies were likely gustnadoes producing very localized winds up to 78 mph. Shortly after midnight CST, the squall line intensified in the southeast Texas Panhandle where downburst winds of at least 74 mph caused numerous instances of mostly minor structural damage in Memphis.",34.38,-100.93

As this storm collapsed, an outrush of damaging winds spread south and east across much of Hale, southern Floyd and northeast Lubbock counties stirring up loose dirt from area fields. The gust front soon developed into a haboob which created about 10 minutes of dust storm conditions at Lubbock International Airport.  Strong and severe thunderstorms soon consolidated into a large squall line along the length of the gust front. Storm motions along the southwest edge of this line slowed to a crawl over much of the southern South Plains where torrential rains deluged many locations in between Highways 380 and 114 from Levelland and Brownfield east to Dickens and Clairemont. Several locations within this area measured between 1 and 2 inches of rain, with officially 2.80 inches recorded at the Texas Tech West Texas Mesonet station located 1W Spur.

The greatest storm coverage occurred during the evening mainly between 630-1130 PM CDT, during which 60 MPH winds were measured at Natoma and hail up to golf ball size fell at Lovewell State Park. Although rainfall in excess of 1-inch was very spotty, a few of the top storm total measurements included 2.49 inches in far northeast Jewell County near Webber and 1.88 inches at Natoma. Prior to the evening activity, the mid morning to late afternoon hours featured a few strong to potentially severe storms that tracked east along the Nebraska border through far northern Phillips, Smith and Mitchell Counties, but these storms yielded no severe-criteria reports. Around the time this initial round started exiting stage-right into northeast Kansas, the second and more significant batch of evening storms flared up. By midnight CDT, all thunderstorm activity had either faded away or slipped out of the local area for the night.   On the synoptic scale aloft, these storms occurred within a typical early-summer pattern with North Central Kansas positioned in the path of weak disturbances embedded in quasi-zonal flow along the northern periphery of a ridge over the southern United States, but well south of the stronger flow over the Northern Plains. At the surface, the primary focus was a nearby quasi-stationary front stretched east-west near the Interstate 70 corridor.

The first round peaked in intensity between 430 PM and 8 PM CDT, developing in response to intense surface heating as temperatures soared into the 100-110F range near a slow-moving cold front. Although radar signatures suggest that severe-criteria gusts of 60 MPH or higher might have affected parts of several counties during this late afternoon/early evening time frame, the only ground-truth reports came out of Mitchell County including a caved-in garage door south of Beloit and a round hay bale rolled across a road near Simpson. Once this initial round of convection moved out of the area to the south and east, a lull ensued before the second round of strong to severe convection flared up after nightfall. This round peaked in intensity between 1030 PM and 1 AM CDT and again consisted of a number of multicell storm clusters and short line segments. Although reports of severe weather were again limited, these nighttime storms dropped golf ball size hail in the community of Jewell and produced a 69 MPH measured gust at the Rooks County airport south of Stockton. Somewhere along the way, a few power poles were also snapped off several miles west of Stockton. Event-total rainfall amounts were highly variable across the area, but most places averaged less than 1 inch. However, considerably higher totals were measured in southern Jewell County, including 3.87 at Jewell and 2.83 in Ionia.   In the mid and upper levels the flow was quasi-zonal, with the primary synoptic forcing for this event consisting of subtle shortwave energy passing through the Central Plains along the southern periphery of a dominant upper low centered near the North Dakota-Manitoba border. At the surface, a slow moving cold front gradually passed through North Central Kansas during the afternoon and evening. Although deep-layer vertical wind shear was rather meager at only around 25 knots at best, at least 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE in the presence of a hot and deeply-mixed airmass with surface temperature-dewpoint depressions on the order of 40-50F was quite favorable for downbursts, especially with the initial round of storms.",39.3363,-98.1917

Dewpoint temperatures pooled along the front to the 65 to 70 degree range.  The atmosphere became unstable with the lifted index falling to around -5 C and CAPE increasing to between 2000 and 4000 J/kg.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 400 and 700 J/kg, but the freezing level was around 15,000 feet and shear 20 kts or less.  Precipitable water values were high at around 2 inches.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds.  A line of thunderstorms formed along the cold front during the early evening hours, rapid intensification once they broke through the cap.  The storms became cold pool dominated by mid evening with the outflow boundary leading the storms by about 30 miles.  Most of the storms produced winds of 50 to 60 MPH, with a few gusts of 65 to 75 MPH.  The highest winds were in Carroll and Poweshiek Counties.  Downdraft CAPE was between 1200 and 1800 J/kg.  There was little tornado threat with the LCL between 2500 and 3500 meters.  There were a few reports of hail, but most of the hail was under an inch in diameter and not a primary event.

423348,12/14/2012 21:30,53,MG,The West Texas Mesonet site in west-northwest of Hereford recorded a 61 mph thunderstorm wind gust.,"An anomalously dynamic upper level system caused a rare severe weather outbreak during the afternoon and evening hours of December 14th. This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front.   Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.     As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads.   Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot’s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).  As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0.   By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.",34.83,-102.43

South winds that had developed over the southern plains tried to bring moisture northward, but quality moisture was lacking, which kept the severe thunderstorm potential more of a marginal threat. A pacific cold front began advancing east through Oklahoma during the late morning hours, with thunderstorms developing over parts of west-central Oklahoma by early afternoon. The thunderstorms were quick moving, and had moved near the I-35 corridor by 3 to 4 pm. Sporadic marginally severe hail was reported, although most locations received much small hail. The main concern with the thunderstorms was the wind. Winds ahead of the front were already gusting over 30 mph. Just off the surface, much higher wind speeds were present. At times, some of the stronger winds would come down to the surface. Strong winds caused isolated areas of damage, with one area near Edmond, Oklahoma, and the other east of Ada, Oklahoma.

A line of thunderstorms formed ahead of a slow moving cold front that advanced east with the upper trough.  Small segmented lines formed that extended east-southeast out of the main north to south line.  These segments lifted rapidly north with the mean flow.  As a result, it was quite easy for the storms to produce high winds.  Winds near 60 MPH caused tree and power pole damage west of the Des Moines Airport with one of the storms.  One of the storms produced a small microburst and winds estimated of at least 75 MPH just west of the Des Moines Airport.  The high winds downed several large trees.

Starting with the Smith County storm, this was an organized, southeast-tracking supercell that crossed into Kansas out of Franklin County Nebraska around 630 PM CDT and eventually weakened near the southern end of the Smith-Jewell county line around 8 PM CDT. As it tracked through Smith County, this storm produced a measured 61 MPH gust at the Smith Center airport and nickel size hail at Bellaire, although radar signatures suggest larger hail likely fell north of Smith Center near the Nebraska border. This storm also showed signs of low-level rotation for a short time, although no tornadoes were reported.  The Rooks County storm was more of a multicell cluster as it entered the county from the west around 6 PM CDT and gradually weakened over southern Osborne County between 730-830 PM CDT. Along the way, 60-65 MPH winds were reported in western Rooks County, including a 64 MPH measured gust north of Damar. The dissipating remnants of both storms completely exited Jewell and Mitchell counties by 930 PM CDT.   On the synoptic scale aloft, this event was driven by the invasion of a subtle shortwave trough embedded in seasonably strong quasi-zonal flow, well south of a primary mid level trough axis extending from Ontario to Montana. At the surface, this storm flared up along a rather well defined pre-frontal trough/dryline extending southward from north central Nebraska. This boundary marked a sharp moisture gradient, separating dewpoints in the 20s-30s F to the west from dewpoints in the upper 50s-lower 60s to the east.

One of these bows struck western and northern portions of the city of Lubbock toppling a brick wall at the Lubbock Christian Universitys baseball field. These winds also lofted small gravel and stones that shattered the windows of approximately 20 cars at Texas Tech University and also broke the windows of a nearby bus stop booth. As these storms swept off the Caprock, their overall intensity diminished. An exception to this occurred in southwest Cottle County where a narrow corridor of fierce winds developed just south of a decaying mesoscale convective vortex. Winds at a Texas Tech University West Texas mesonet station located ten miles west-southwest of Paducah were clocked as high as 96 mph within this downburst. Farther north, a slow-moving supercell developed in western Briscoe County and drifted southeast directly over Caprock Canyons State Park accompanied by torrential rain rates of three inches per hour. These rains deluged the park and produced flash flooding along a normally dry creek that drains into Lake Theo.

Feeding on a very unstable atmosphere  - cold and dry air well above the earth’s surface - initial storms would slam Zapata County during lunchtime with damaging wind, large hail, flooding rain, and frequent lightning. As the afternoon progressed, increasing contrast between cooler air across the South Texas Plains (60s and 70s) with the last of the early May heat in the Rio Grande Valley (90s) set the stage for additional storms with damaging winds and flooding rain in Zapata, and culminated with a monster supercell thunderstorm which cruised from southwest Brooks County through Raymondville before weakening.  This impressive supercell storm dominated the episode, and produced a measured instantaneous wind gust over 100 mph in rural Hidalgo County. Fortunately for the populated middle Valley, where more than 700,000 persons are at risk, this cell slid through northern Hidalgo County north of the SR 186 and U.S. 281 interchange, and accelerated through the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge northeast of Linn and San Manuel before reaching Raymondville (Willacy County).

365301,4/15/2012 0:48,55,MG,Measured by NWS employee.,"The first significant severe weather outbreak of the season took place during the afternoon and evening of the 14th with all modes of severe weather taking place.  An upper level low pressure lifted northeast out of the southwest U.S.  The upper level center, as well as the surface low, passed northwest of Iowa, across southeast South Dakota into Minnesota.  Severe weather developed north of the warm front as it lifted north into Iowa.  A cluster of severe storms formed over northeast Kansas and southeast Nebraska.  These storms moved east-northeast along the warm front into Iowa, causing a considerable amount of severe weather.  Severe weather parameters were fairly strong, however the dynamics of a 100 kt mid level jet and 60 kt low level jet made up the difference.  Just prior to the storm development, CAPE values were around 4000 J/kg south of the development.  Helicity was high, in the 300 to 500 range.  There was a large amount of effective shear with 50 to 65 kts available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere was in the 200 to 400 J/kg range, while downdraft CAPE was 600 to 800 J/kg.  Plenty of low level moisture was drawn into the state on the strong low level jet.  Precipitable water vales rose to 1.25 inches quite rapidly.  The LCL level was relatively high, but given the dynmics was relatively easy to overcome.  The LCL was just under 1000 meters at the beginning of the event.  There were three tornadoes reported during the event.  One was northwest of the Creston area in Union County.  The most significant tornado caused high end EF2 damage to the far northwest corner of Creston. This tornado formed southwest of Cromwell at 1752 CST in Adams county and quickly tracked into northwest Creston around 1800 CST. EF2 damage occurred to the Greater Regional Medical Center and the Southwestern Community College campus. The tornado continued tracking to the northeast and damaged several farmsteads northeast of Creston before dissipating about 10 miles northeast of town at approximately 1815 CST.  The wind strength was estimated to be 130 MPH. Significant damage occurred with uninsured damage alone near $2,000,000.  A tornado touched down in Warren County east of New Virginia.  The tornado caused damage to farm buildings and campers with a considerable amount of sheet metal left lying around.  The EF1 tornado produced winds around 100 MPH.  Many of the thunderstorms brought with them high winds and hail.  The final tornado touched down in Mahaska County.  The tornado was an EF1 tornado with a broad and intense rear flank downdraft south of the track.  The AWOS site at the Oskaloosa airport in Mahaska County recorded a 97 MPH wind gust from the rear flank downdraft of the storm. Reports from the Emergency Manager indicated that damage at the airport was limited to two hangar doors and some damage to airport buildings.  There were no planes on the field at the time. Numerous reports of hail larger than quarter size were received.  Some of the larger hail included baseball size hail in Clarke County at Murray and numerous reports of golf ball size hail along the track of the severe cluster from Union County to Mahaska County.  The same cluster of storms also produced very strong winds along its path.  Numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds were received all along the path.  Numerous reports of tree and power line damage were received.  The Des Moines metro area was hard hit with winds of up to 65 MPH causing considerable tree damage.  At one time, 20,000 customers were reported without power.  In Marion County a garage was destroyed and a house significantly damaged by the wind east of Knoxville.   The storms also produced very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was reported at several locations.  At the Des Moines International Airport, 1.10 inches of rain fell between 1630 and 1637 CST.  This amount of rainfall in that short of period of time was a 100 year event.

377064,6/15/2012 0:15,55,MG,Measured by a Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet station.,"A small cluster of strong and slow-moving thunderstorms developed late this afternoon in and around the Muleshoe area and dropped hail up to penny size. By early evening, outflow from these collapsing storms gave rise to a particularly tall and intense storm in northwest Hale County. As this storm collapsed, an outrush of damaging winds spread south and east across much of Hale, southern Floyd and northeast Lubbock counties stirring up loose dirt from area fields. The gust front soon developed into a haboob which created about 10 minutes of dust storm conditions at Lubbock International Airport.  Strong and severe thunderstorms soon consolidated into a large squall line along the length of the gust front. Storm motions along the southwest edge of this line slowed to a crawl over much of the southern South Plains where torrential rains deluged many locations in between Highways 380 and 114 from Levelland and Brownfield east to Dickens and Clairemont. Several locations within this area measured between 1 and 2 inches of rain, with officially 2.80 inches recorded at the Texas Tech West Texas Mesonet station located 1W Spur. Generally minor flooding of roads was common in southern Hockley, northeast Terry, southern Lubbock, and northern Lynn Counties; however Farm-to-Market Road 1585 was observed to be covered in standing water for several miles east of Highway 385 in southeast Hockley County.

Although damage was not overly significant and storm reports were limited, automated airport sensors in or near Phillipsburg, Stockton, Smith Center and Beloit measured peak gusts between 58-63 MPH. In addition, a patio roof was torn off in Logan. Hail was not a major issue with these storms, with the largest reported hail only penny size in Burr Oak. Rainfall-wise, much of the area tallied over 1 inch but the highest totals in excess of 3 inches focused across parts of Jewell and Mitchell Counties, including 3.37 inches at Burr Oak. Despite this heavy rain, there were no reports of significant flooding.   Breaking down event timing, the initial development between 6 PM and 730 PM CDT occurred in two separate areas, with one storm cluster pushing in from the west across Phillips, Rooks and Smith Counties, while other storms built south into Jewell County out of Nebraska. Then between 730 and 9 PM CDT, these separate clusters merged into a nearly solid line, with the main part of the line exiting the local area out of Osborne and Mitchell Counties by 930 PM CDT.  Although additional storms lingered over parts of the area past midnight CDT, none were severe. These North Central Kansas storms evolved out of earlier severe storms that developed across southern Nebraska during the afternoon hours along a slow-moving cold front. In the mid and upper levels, synoptic scale forcing was relatively weak, with the area positioned well south of a stronger shortwave trough swinging across southern Canada and the Dakotas. However, with surface dewpoints averaging well into the 60s F, convective instability was quite high with early evening mixed-layer CAPE climbing to at least 2000-3000 J/kg. On the other hand, 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear was fairly weak at only around 30 knots, which allowed initially slow-moving storms to congeal into a line and surge southeast along strong outflow.

Winds were clocked at 78 mph at the Appleton Airport, and knocked down power lines, tore open a machine shed on a farm place north of Appleton, and twisted the foundation for a grain dryer, snapping the liquid propane line to it.  Five power poles along Minnesota Highway 7 just north of Appleton were toppled, knocking out power to rural areas and about ¼ of Appleton for two to three hours.  In Lac Qui Parle County, the winds tore metal roofing off a portion of a building in Madison, and snapped small tree branches in town.  In eastern Kandiyohi County, the roof of a shed at the Central Lakes Cooperative just outside of Atwater was torn off and a turkey barn on Highway 12 was damaged.  Highway crews used snowplows to move numerous branches from State Highway 12 in Atwater, and power was affected in five substations in the region, particularly the one in Atwater.  The western and northwestern portions of Meeker County were hit hard with severe damage around Grove City, where at least 14 buildings were damaged, including six turkey barns, sheds, grain bins and one residence with extensive roof damage.  The Meeker Cooperative said more than 30 power poles were lost and numerous lines downed because of wind and falling trees.  The athletic fields at the High School in Grove City were damaged, with football bleachers flipped over onto the field and a dugout damaged on the baseball field.

423342,12/14/2012 21:57,56,MG,The KVII schoolnet mesonet site on the northwest side of Amarillo recorded a 64 mph thunderstorm wind gust.,"An anomalously dynamic upper level system caused a rare severe weather outbreak during the afternoon and evening hours of December 14th. This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front.   Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.     As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads.   Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot’s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).  As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0.   By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.",35.23,-101.86
357832,2/20/2012 22:25,56,MG,nan,"A potent, quick-moving storm system affected Oklahoma during the afternoon of the 22nd, with strong winds, small hail, and brief heavy rainfall. South winds that had developed over the southern plains tried to bring moisture northward, but quality moisture was lacking, which kept the severe thunderstorm potential more of a marginal threat. A pacific cold front began advancing east through Oklahoma during the late morning hours, with thunderstorms developing over parts of west-central Oklahoma by early afternoon. The thunderstorms were quick moving, and had moved near the I-35 corridor by 3 to 4 pm. Sporadic marginally severe hail was reported, although most locations received much small hail. The main concern with the thunderstorms was the wind. Winds ahead of the front were already gusting over 30 mph. Just off the surface, much higher wind speeds were present. At times, some of the stronger winds would come down to the surface. Strong winds caused isolated areas of damage, with one area near Edmond, Oklahoma, and the other east of Ada, Oklahoma. The non-tornadic winds east of Ada approached 100 mph, causing substantial damage to a double-wide trailer. The damage was local however, with very little damage in the surrounding areas. The storms moved into eastern Oklahoma by the early evening hours.",36.3664,-97.1318

Around dawn, a warm front moved north of the Ohio River.  Scattered strong storms developed along this front across northern Kentucky, bringing several reports of dime sized hail.  By mid afternoon, the combination of strong wind shear, temperatures rising to the upper 70s and over 2000 Joules/kg of CAPE led to the development of numerous supercells.  Several of these storms produced tornadoes not only in north central Kentucky, but later in the evening across eastern Kentucky. Large hail was common, with several reports of baseball sized hail that damaged automobiles and roofs.",36.97,-86.44

The wind snapped a tree off just above ground level and also downed many limbs in the Hastings area.,"A strong upper level system over the southern Rockies lifted northeast across the plains causing an intense surface low pressure system and attendant warm front to lift into Nebraska.  The main warm front remained either in southern Nebraska or in Kansas, and the shear and instability associated with the system produced widespread multi-cellular convection with embedded super cell thunderstorms near and north of the front.  The more surface based super cells produced several tornadoes in southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, while more elevated storms in northeast Nebraska produced very large hail.  In addition, areas of very heavy rain produced isolated flash and river flooding across the area.  The severe weather came in several waves, the first one came through in the afternoon with the second a little after midnight CDT.",41.01,-95.5
365288,4/15/2012 0:51,56,MG,South wind of 65 MPH was measured at the Blank Park Zoo.,"The first significant severe weather outbreak of the season took place during the afternoon and evening of the 14th with all modes of severe weather taking place.  An upper level low pressure lifted northeast out of the southwest U.S.  The upper level center, as well as the surface low, passed northwest of Iowa, across southeast South Dakota into Minnesota.  Severe weather developed north of the warm front as it lifted north into Iowa.  A cluster of severe storms formed over northeast Kansas and southeast Nebraska.  These storms moved east-northeast along the warm front into Iowa, causing a considerable amount of severe weather.  Severe weather parameters were fairly strong, however the dynamics of a 100 kt mid level jet and 60 kt low level jet made up the difference.  Just prior to the storm development, CAPE values were around 4000 J/kg south of the development.  Helicity was high, in the 300 to 500 range.  There was a large amount of effective shear with 50 to 65 kts available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere was in the 200 to 400 J/kg range, while downdraft CAPE was 600 to 800 J/kg.  Plenty of low level moisture was drawn into the state on the strong low level jet.  Precipitable water vales rose to 1.25 inches quite rapidly.  The LCL level was relatively high, but given the dynmics was relatively easy to overcome.  The LCL was just under 1000 meters at the beginning of the event.  There were three tornadoes reported during the event.  One was northwest of the Creston area in Union County.  The most significant tornado caused high end EF2 damage to the far northwest corner of Creston. This tornado formed southwest of Cromwell at 1752 CST in Adams county and quickly tracked into northwest Creston around 1800 CST. EF2 damage occurred to the Greater Regional Medical Center and the Southwestern Community College campus. The tornado continued tracking to the northeast and damaged several farmsteads northeast of Creston before dissipating about 10 miles northeast of town at approximately 1815 CST.  The wind strength was estimated to be 130 MPH. Significant damage occurred with uninsured damage alone near $2,000,000.  A tornado touched down in Warren County east of New Virginia.  The tornado caused damage to farm buildings and campers with a considerable amount of sheet metal left lying around.  The EF1 tornado produced winds around 100 MPH.  Many of the thunderstorms brought with them high winds and hail.  The final tornado touched down in Mahaska County.  The tornado was an EF1 tornado with a broad and intense rear flank downdraft south of the track.  The AWOS site at the Oskaloosa airport in Mahaska County recorded a 97 MPH wind gust from the rear flank downdraft of the storm. Reports from the Emergency Manager indicated that damage at the airport was limited to two hangar doors and some damage to airport buildings.  There were no planes on the field at the time. Numerous reports of hail larger than quarter size were received.  Some of the larger hail included baseball size hail in Clarke County at Murray and numerous reports of golf ball size hail along the track of the severe cluster from Union County to Mahaska County.  The same cluster of storms also produced very strong winds along its path.  Numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds were received all along the path.  Numerous reports of tree and power line damage were received.  The Des Moines metro area was hard hit with winds of up to 65 MPH causing considerable tree damage.  At one time, 20,000 customers were reported without power.  In Marion County a garage was destroyed and a house significantly damaged by the wind east of Knoxville.   The storms also produced very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was reported at several locations.  At the Des Moines International Airport, 1.10 inches of rain fell between 1630 and 1637 CST.  This amount of rainfall in that short of period of time was a 100 year event.  Fortunately it had been quite dry across the state, limiting the flash flood potential.  Flash flooding was reported in Polk, Cass, and Madison Counties.  Water was reported flowing one to two feet deep.  Numerous reports were also received of street flooding and significant ponding.",41.58,-93.62

By early evening, these storms solidified into a squall line and accelerated east across the western South Plains of Texas where strong instability resided. Although several wind gusts just shy of 58 mph were measured by various Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet sites across the western South Plains, a few winds gusts as high as 65 mph did eventually occur later in the evening. These winds created a large dustfoot along the length of the gust front that reduced visibilities in most areas to a few miles, with isolated instances of near zero visibilities downwind of cotton fields near Wolfforth.  As the squall line entered southwest Lubbock County, an east-west oriented line of storms intersected the line and resulted in one intense storm that produced localized large hail. Of greater significance was the torrential rainfall rates up to 3.5 inches per hour over much of the city of Lubbock. Widespread rainfall totals in this area of over one inch in a short period of time resulted in widespread street flooding.  By late this night, the 140 mile-long squall line began dissipating near the Caprock Escarpment.

Starting with the Smith County storm, this was an organized, southeast-tracking supercell that crossed into Kansas out of Franklin County Nebraska around 630 PM CDT and eventually weakened near the southern end of the Smith-Jewell county line around 8 PM CDT. As it tracked through Smith County, this storm produced a measured 61 MPH gust at the Smith Center airport and nickel size hail at Bellaire, although radar signatures suggest larger hail likely fell north of Smith Center near the Nebraska border. This storm also showed signs of low-level rotation for a short time, although no tornadoes were reported.  The Rooks County storm was more of a multicell cluster as it entered the county from the west around 6 PM CDT and gradually weakened over southern Osborne County between 730-830 PM CDT. Along the way, 60-65 MPH winds were reported in western Rooks County, including a 64 MPH measured gust north of Damar. The dissipating remnants of both storms completely exited Jewell and Mitchell counties by 930 PM CDT.   On the synoptic scale aloft, this event was driven by the invasion of a subtle shortwave trough embedded in seasonably strong quasi-zonal flow, well south of a primary mid level trough axis extending from Ontario to Montana. At the surface, this storm flared up along a rather well defined pre-frontal trough/dryline extending southward from north central Nebraska. This boundary marked a sharp moisture gradient, separating dewpoints in the 20s-30s F to the west from dewpoints in the upper 50s-lower 60s to the east.

These storms prompted issuance of the first November severe thunderstorm warnings within the local 24-county area since 2005. Despite the rather widespread coverage of storms, which mainly took the form of line segments and multicell clusters, most of them produced only very small hail and sub-severe wind gusts. The handful of severe-criteria reports were highlighted by half dollar to golf ball size hail in eastern Howard County and a measured 64 MPH wind gust near Red Cloud.   The initial rounds of strong to severe storms developed and intensified between 330 PM and 630 PM, concentrated along a narrow axis extending from the Franklin and Red Cloud areas, north-northeast through the Hastings, Grand Island and Fullerton areas. During these early stages of the event, one storm briefly intensified and became quasi-discrete as it tracked through eastern Howard County, producing large hail. Generally between 630 PM and 9 PM, most of the quasi-linear activity concentrated east of a Red Cloud-Aurora-Genoa line, before gradually departing the local area to the east. Rainfall totals from these storms were mainly less than one inch, with one of the higher exceptions including 1.35 near Gresham in York County. On the synoptic scale aloft, this event was driven by increased forcing along the eastern fringes of a deep, expansive trough dominating the entire western half of the nation. At the surface, a warm front initially surged northward into most of South Central Nebraska during the day, resulting in daily record high temperatures in the upper-70s at places such as Grand Island and Hastings. Surface dewpoints also climbed into the 50s along and ahead of this boundary during the afternoon before it began sliding southeast as a cold front. Late afternoon/early evening mesoscale severe weather parameters featured up to around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and strong 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of at least 50-70 knots. Low level shear was also quite strong, making the environment at least marginally supportive of tornadoes.

423347,12/14/2012 21:30,57,MG,The KVII schoolnet mesonet site in Hereford recorded a thunderstorm wind gust of 66 mph.,"An anomalously dynamic upper level system caused a rare severe weather outbreak during the afternoon and evening hours of December 14th. This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front.   Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.     As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads.   Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot’s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).  As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0.   By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.",34.84,-102.41
364377,3/19/2012 1:35,57,MG,Measured by the Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet near Silverton.,"Two separate rounds of severe thunderstorms developed the afternoon and evening of the 18th ahead of a vigorous upper level trough. By mid-afternoon, a dryline ignited widely scattered supercell thunderstorms from near Childress south to near Aspermont.  Marginally severe hail was common with these supercells. One storm south of Guthrie produced a funnel cloud observed by storm chasers. As the dryline retreated early in the evening, a left-moving supercell organized in northwest Garza County and raced north-northeast at highway speeds for the next 2.5 hours accompanied by large hail up to golfball size and severe winds.  A second and more extensive round of thunderstorms emerged late on the 18th across the southwest South Plains as a Pacific cold front collided with the retreating dryline.  The result was an extensive squall line that at one point extended from the Oklahoma Panhandle south to the western Permian Basin. Strong low-level shear in the vicinity of this squall line resulted in the formation of at least three persistent, non-tornadic circulations as observed by the NWS-LBB WSR-88D. One of these circulations was sampled in high detail by research meteorologists from Texas Tech University near Reese Center using mobile Doppler radars and high resolution surface stations (sticknets). The mobile data collected suggests these vorticies were likely gustnadoes producing very localized winds up to 78 mph. Shortly after midnight CST, the squall line intensified in the southeast Texas Panhandle where downburst winds of at least 74 mph caused numerous instances of mostly minor structural damage in Memphis.",34.43,-101.19

361048,3/19/2012 21:50,57,MG,nan,"A very strong upper level trough of low pressure was in place to the west of Iowa.  Unseasonably warm and moist air pushed north into the state.  Record high temperatures occurred for several days, and on the 19th continued over the central and eastern part of the state.  Temperatures warmed into the low 80s with dewpoint readings in the low 60s.  The atmosphere became unstable with lifted indices around -3 C and most unstable CAPE values in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  The wind profile was fairly unidirectional, however speeds in the 850 to 500 mb level were in the 45 to 65 kt range.  Downdraft CAPE was around 600 J/kg.  Though the freezing level was quite low for a severe weather event, around 11,200 feet, CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was limited to around 100 J/kg.  Combined with very high precipitable water values, around 1.4 inches, the hail production was limited.  There was a decent amount of shear available for the storms with a shear value around 40 kts.  A line of thunderstorms formed ahead of a slow moving cold front that advanced east with the upper trough.  Small segmented lines formed that extended east-southeast out of the main north to south line.  These segments lifted rapidly north with the mean flow.  As a result, it was quite easy for the storms to produce high winds.  Winds near 60 MPH caused tree and power pole damage west of the Des Moines Airport with one of the storms.  One of the storms produced a small microburst and winds estimated of at least 75 MPH just west of the Des Moines Airport.  The high winds downed several large trees.  A small line segment produced 60 to 65 MPH winds as it moved through Hamilton County, north through the Mason City area in Cerro Gordo County.",42.48,-93.55

380834,5/19/2012 23:15,57,MG,nan,"Ending a lull of over two weeks without severe thunderstorms, this Saturday afternoon and early evening featured several reports of damaging winds, large hail and gustnadoes, primarily focused within southern and eastern counties of South Central Nebraska such as Webster, Clay, Nuckolls and Fillmore. During the height of the event between 4-7 PM CDT, some of the most significant wind damage occurred in the Hardy and Ruskin areas, where winds estimated to around 75 MPH overturned irrigation pivots, downed power poles and caved in several steel corn seed storage tanks. Also, 66-68 MPH wind gusts were measured near Deweese and at the York airport. Although several gustnadoes were reported in these areas, some of which resembled true tornadoes per storm chaser video, these were typically brief circulations focused along storm outflow and not directly associated with cloud base rotation. As for large hail, there were several reports of 1.5 to 2-inch diameter stones, including nearly 20 minutes of golf ball size hail east of Blue Hill. Very early in the event around 3 PM CDT, an elevated severe storm in far western South Central Nebraska dumped hail up to ping pong ball size northwest of Gothenburg. Rainfall-wise, although the progressive nature of most storms kept amounts under 2 inches, one localized corridor in far northern portions of the 24-county area between Spalding and Greeley tallied 3.28 inches from the cumulative effect of several passing storms.   Breaking down event timing, the first severe storm of the day was the aforementioned elevated post-frontal hail storm that swept across western Dawson County around 3 PM CDT. This ended up being the only storm to reach severe criteria across the western half of South Central Nebraska, as the vast majority of severe weather occurred with surface-based storms erupting near the Highway 281 corridor between 4-5 PM CDT, and eventually exiting the area into eastern Nebraska between 7-8 PM CDT. These storms, which developed along a well-defined surface cold front, started out as three semi-discrete supercells. However, the supercells quickly morphed into a quasi-linear complex due to cell mergers and eastward-surging outflow boundaries in an environment characterized by surface temperature-dewpoint spreads around 20 degrees or greater. Behind the main line of surface based storms, a few severe post-frontal storms flared up near Highway 281 between 6-7 PM CDT, producing nickel to ping pong ball size hail in and just east of Grand Island. The last band of strong storms of the evening departed the Greeley and Nance County area around 9 PM CDT.   On the synoptic scale this was a rather strongly forced severe weather event, as a vigorous shortwave trough migrated from eastern Colorado across southern Nebraska, while at the surface, a sharp north-south oriented cold front reached a position near the Highway 281 corridor by mid-afternoon. Mesoscale severe weather parameters around the time of initial surface-based supercell development included 40-50 knots of 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear and 1500-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE. Despite several reports of gustnadoes, a more substantial tornado threat was likely mitigated by somewhat meager boundary layer moisture with surface dewpoints only between 55-60F, resulting in higher cloud bases and enhanced outflow.",40.88,-97.58
379859,5/28/2012 0:04,57,MG,Equipment located at the local elementary school recorded a wind gust of 66 mph.,"Sunday evening of Memorial Day weekend featured a barrage of severe thunderstorms with large hail, primarily affecting Phillips, Rooks and Smith Counties within this six-county portion of North Central Kansas. For roughly 3.5 hours between 6-930 PM CDT, there were multiple reports of hail ranging from quarter to baseball size. The largest reported stones of 2.50-2.75 inches fell in Kirwin around 725 PM CDT. Hail of 1.75-2.00 inches in diameter fell in or near Athol, Webster Reservoir, Speed and Glade, with a home northwest of Glade suffering the loss of all south-facing windows. Although reports of severe-criteria wind gusts were sparse, a 66 MPH gust was measured at the Phillipsburg elementary school. Rainfall-wise, most areas averaged less than one inch, but a small corridor including Prairie View in northwest Phillips County measured 2.15 inches.   The coverage of storms during this event was rather widespread within the aforementioned three counties, with considerable development and intensification taking place between 6-7 PM CDT just east of a nearly stationary north-south surface dryline. Storm mode consisted of a mixed bag of fast-moving multicell and small supercells streaming north-northeast across the area. The last severe storm of the night within the local six-county area exited far northern Phillips County into Nebraska around 930 PM CDT. A bit later around 1030 PM CDT an isolated severe storm tried pushing into southeastern Mitchell County from Lincoln County but weakened as it did so. This severe weather event was anticipated several days in advance, and featured a Moderate Risk Day 1 Convective Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center. The primary forcing mechanism aloft was a strong shortwave pushing northeast out of Colorado, along the southeast periphery of a deep mid-level low centered in Montana. At the surface, the aforementioned dryline served as the primary low-level trigger, as it aligned from north central Kansas to the eastern Texas Panhandle at mid-afternoon. As this strong upper forcing intercepted the dryline and severe storms erupted, mesoscale convective parameters featured between 1000-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and impressive 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear of 50-70 knots. A potential tornado threat was likely kept in check by somewhat high cloud bases, resulting from surface temperature-dewpoint spreads of 20-30F early in the event.",39.75,-99.32

Numerous trees, power lines, barns and roofs were damaged or destroyed across a large portion in southern Minnesota.  Winds were clocked at 78 mph at the Appleton Airport, and knocked down power lines, tore open a machine shed on a farm place north of Appleton, and twisted the foundation for a grain dryer, snapping the liquid propane line to it.  Five power poles along Minnesota Highway 7 just north of Appleton were toppled, knocking out power to rural areas and about ¼ of Appleton for two to three hours.  In Lac Qui Parle County, the winds tore metal roofing off a portion of a building in Madison, and snapped small tree branches in town.  In eastern Kandiyohi County, the roof of a shed at the Central Lakes Cooperative just outside of Atwater was torn off and a turkey barn on Highway 12 was damaged.  Highway crews used snowplows to move numerous branches from State Highway 12 in Atwater, and power was affected in five substations in the region, particularly the one in Atwater.  The western and northwestern portions of Meeker County were hit hard with severe damage around Grove City, where at least 14 buildings were damaged, including six turkey barns, sheds, grain bins and one residence with extensive roof damage.  The Meeker Cooperative said more than 30 power poles were lost and numerous lines downed because of wind and falling trees.  The athletic fields at the High School in Grove City were damaged, with football bleachers flipped over onto the field and a dugout damaged on the baseball field.  A section of State Highway 4 in Meeker County was shut down due to debris on the road.  Golf ball sized hail and some two inches in diameter were reported in Le Sueur, Rice and Goodhue counties but no major damage was reported.  In addition to the severe winds and hail, very heavy rainfall occurred, especially in the communities of Willmar, Cannon Falls, and Jordan. All three areas reported rainfall of more than 3 inches, with led to flooding.  Transportation officials closed Highway 20 near Cannon Falls and Highway 50 near Miesville Monday morning due to flooding. The flooding damaged roads, bridges, utilities, buildings and recreation areas. Preliminary damage assessments revealed more than 5 million dollars in costs and damages.

Warm advection over the frontal boundary produced scattered thunderstorms through the night of the 28th into the day on the 29th.  Nickel size hail fell from one of the storms in Marshall County during the morning of the the 29th.  During the day the atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE increasing to 4000-5000 J/kg and the lifted index falling to -11 C.  High temperatures reached into the 90s with dewpoint readings in the low 70s across southern Iowa.  Considerable downdraft CAPE was available, in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range.  The soundings were relatively dry in the low levels with a LCL around 1500 meters.  Precipitable water was around 1.6 inches.  There was 700 to 1000 J/kg of CAPE available in the -10 to 30 C layer of the atmosphere, though with the freezing level just over 15,000 feet.  That limited the size of the hail.  The atmosphere became moderately sheared as a weak shortwave moved east along the front during the afternoon.  There was 45 to 55 kts of shear available.  A cluster of storms formed in western Iowa and advanced east.  They produced gusty winds and some hail.  One inch diameter hail fell in Dallas County at De Soto.  As the thunderstorms moved east, they intensified.  With the deeper storm depth, the strongest cluster of storms was able to realize the high CAPE values for both hail and downdraft CAPE.  Wind gusts around 60 MPH and hail of 1 to 2.5 inches in diameter occurred in Marion, Jasper, and Poweshiek Counties.  The winds blew down large branches in the area.

423346,12/14/2012 21:44,59,MG,The KVII schoolnet mesonet site southeast of Buffalo Lake in Randall County recorded a 68 mph thunderstorm wind gust.,"An anomalously dynamic upper level system caused a rare severe weather outbreak during the afternoon and evening hours of December 14th. This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front.   Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.     As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads.   Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot’s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).  As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0.   By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.",34.76,-101.96

380831,5/19/2012 22:12,59,MG,A wind gust of 68 mph was measured near the intersection of Highways 14 and 4.,"Ending a lull of over two weeks without severe thunderstorms, this Saturday afternoon and early evening featured several reports of damaging winds, large hail and gustnadoes, primarily focused within southern and eastern counties of South Central Nebraska such as Webster, Clay, Nuckolls and Fillmore. During the height of the event between 4-7 PM CDT, some of the most significant wind damage occurred in the Hardy and Ruskin areas, where winds estimated to around 75 MPH overturned irrigation pivots, downed power poles and caved in several steel corn seed storage tanks. Also, 66-68 MPH wind gusts were measured near Deweese and at the York airport. Although several gustnadoes were reported in these areas, some of which resembled true tornadoes per storm chaser video, these were typically brief circulations focused along storm outflow and not directly associated with cloud base rotation. As for large hail, there were several reports of 1.5 to 2-inch diameter stones, including nearly 20 minutes of golf ball size hail east of Blue Hill. Very early in the event around 3 PM CDT, an elevated severe storm in far western South Central Nebraska dumped hail up to ping pong ball size northwest of Gothenburg. Rainfall-wise, although the progressive nature of most storms kept amounts under 2 inches, one localized corridor in far northern portions of the 24-county area between Spalding and Greeley tallied 3.28 inches from the cumulative effect of several passing storms.   Breaking down event timing, the first severe storm of the day was the aforementioned elevated post-frontal hail storm that swept across western Dawson County around 3 PM CDT. This ended up being the only storm to reach severe criteria across the western half of South Central Nebraska, as the vast majority of severe weather occurred with surface-based storms erupting near the Highway 281 corridor between 4-5 PM CDT, and eventually exiting the area into eastern Nebraska between 7-8 PM CDT. These storms, which developed along a well-defined surface cold front, started out as three semi-discrete supercells. However, the supercells quickly morphed into a quasi-linear complex due to cell mergers and eastward-surging outflow boundaries in an environment characterized by surface temperature-dewpoint spreads around 20 degrees or greater. Behind the main line of surface based storms, a few severe post-frontal storms flared up near Highway 281 between 6-7 PM CDT, producing nickel to ping pong ball size hail in and just east of Grand Island. The last band of strong storms of the evening departed the Greeley and Nance County area around 9 PM CDT.   On the synoptic scale this was a rather strongly forced severe weather event, as a vigorous shortwave trough migrated from eastern Colorado across southern Nebraska, while at the surface, a sharp north-south oriented cold front reached a position near the Highway 281 corridor by mid-afternoon. Mesoscale severe weather parameters around the time of initial surface-based supercell development included 40-50 knots of 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear and 1500-2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE. Despite several reports of gustnadoes, a more substantial tornado threat was likely mitigated by somewhat meager boundary layer moisture with surface dewpoints only between 55-60F, resulting in higher cloud bases and enhanced outflow.",40.31,-98.09

The storms tracked northeast and kept developing a bit farther southeast into the evening as the front slowly pushed southeast toward Omaha and Lincoln.  Later that evening and overnight, thunderstorms developed farther northwest of the front aided by an upper level disturbance and increasing low level jet.  Outflow from many of the storms in the late afternoon and evening produced swirling dust devils that prompted several reports of tornadoes.  However, most if not all of the tornado reports with this event were likely non-tornadic.  However, some of the storms did produce damaging winds through mid evening.

At least 4 power poles were damaged, multiple tree limbs were knocked down, and tin was removed from an outbuilding.","Between 4 PM CDT on Wednesday afternoon the 25th and 130 AM CDT on early Thursday morning the 26th, the majority of this six-county area experienced two separate rounds of fairly widespread strong to severe multicell storms. The first round peaked in intensity between 430 PM and 8 PM CDT, developing in response to intense surface heating as temperatures soared into the 100-110F range near a slow-moving cold front. Although radar signatures suggest that severe-criteria gusts of 60 MPH or higher might have affected parts of several counties during this late afternoon/early evening time frame, the only ground-truth reports came out of Mitchell County including a caved-in garage door south of Beloit and a round hay bale rolled across a road near Simpson. Once this initial round of convection moved out of the area to the south and east, a lull ensued before the second round of strong to severe convection flared up after nightfall. This round peaked in intensity between 1030 PM and 1 AM CDT and again consisted of a number of multicell storm clusters and short line segments. Although reports of severe weather were again limited, these nighttime storms dropped golf ball size hail in the community of Jewell and produced a 69 MPH measured gust at the Rooks County airport south of Stockton. Somewhere along the way, a few power poles were also snapped off several miles west of Stockton. Event-total rainfall amounts were highly variable across the area, but most places averaged less than 1 inch. However, considerably higher totals were measured in southern Jewell County, including 3.87 at Jewell and 2.83 in Ionia.   In the mid and upper levels the flow was quasi-zonal, with the primary synoptic forcing for this event consisting of subtle shortwave energy passing through the Central Plains along the southern periphery of a dominant upper low centered near the North Dakota-Manitoba border. At the surface, a slow moving cold front gradually passed through North Central Kansas during the afternoon and evening. Although deep-layer vertical wind shear was rather meager at only around 25 knots at best, at least 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE in the presence of a hot and deeply-mixed airmass with surface temperature-dewpoint depressions on the order of 40-50F was quite favorable for downbursts, especially with the initial round of storms.",39.3525,-99.5222

412631,11/11/2012 5:16,61,MG,Measured at St Paul Holman Field.,"A record breaking day occurred across the Upper Midwest as temperatures soared into the 60s and 70s across southern Minnesota during the afternoon of Saturday, November 10th.  Thunderstorms developed across eastern Nebraska late in the day, and moved northeast across southern Minnesota during the evening. A powerful low level jet of 65 knots developed ahead of a strong cold front late Saturday evening. This low level jet combined with ample instability to create several lines of thunderstorms across southern Minnesota. One line of thunderstorms moved through the southern and eastern metro area of the Twin Cities, and produced four EF-0 tornadoes, along with damaging straight line winds. One tornado moved through the Burnsville area, the second moved through Eagan, the third occurred near Lilydale, and the fourth hit Mahtomedi and Grant.  In addition to the tornadoes, there was a long path of damaging straight line winds that caused numerous large trees to blow down onto houses, cars and other public and private structures.  These were the latest Minnesota tornadoes in a calendar year in the Storm Prediction Center database (which began in 1950), although there may have been one later tornado on Nov 16, 1931 (but records of tornadoes were not maintained before 1950).",44.9362,-93.0638

Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jacksons area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds.

By mid-afternoon, a dryline ignited widely scattered supercell thunderstorms from near Childress south to near Aspermont.  Marginally severe hail was common with these supercells. One storm south of Guthrie produced a funnel cloud observed by storm chasers. As the dryline retreated early in the evening, a left-moving supercell organized in northwest Garza County and raced north-northeast at highway speeds for the next 2.5 hours accompanied by large hail up to golfball size and severe winds.  A second and more extensive round of thunderstorms emerged late on the 18th across the southwest South Plains as a Pacific cold front collided with the retreating dryline.  The result was an extensive squall line that at one point extended from the Oklahoma Panhandle south to the western Permian Basin. Strong low-level shear in the vicinity of this squall line resulted in the formation of at least three persistent, non-tornadic circulations as observed by the NWS-LBB WSR-88D. One of these circulations was sampled in high detail by research meteorologists from Texas Tech University near Reese Center using mobile Doppler radars and high resolution surface stations (sticknets). The mobile data collected suggests these vorticies were likely gustnadoes producing very localized winds up to 78 mph.

A weak surface low moved into the northeast South Plains early in the afternoon and enhanced lift along a sharp dryline and residual outflow boundary. By mid-afternoon, a pair of thunderstorms erupted in Hall and Motley Counties and quickly became supercells while moving to the east and southeast. These storms produced very large and even giant hail at times and were accompanied by intense inflow and outflow wind gusts at or above 60 mph.  The second of these supercells produced several gustnadoes and at least four weak, non-mesocyclonic tornadoes under its flanking line as it moved through central Cottle County. However, all of the damage in and around the Paducah area was attributed to ferocious winds in the rear flank downdraft (RFD) of this supercell. Although NWS radars from both Lubbock, TX and Frederick, OK indicated a high probability of a significant tornado in far eastern Cottle County from this same storm, a NWS storm survey found no such evidence despite a large tornado having occurred a short while later in nearby western Foard County.  By early evening, a third supercell developed northwest of Paducah and tracked south-southeast into King County. This storm produced a weak tornado about nine miles west of Paducah that moved over open land before crossing Highway 70 and dissipating.

By mid-afternoon, a dryline ignited widely scattered supercell thunderstorms from near Childress south to near Aspermont.  Marginally severe hail was common with these supercells. One storm south of Guthrie produced a funnel cloud observed by storm chasers. As the dryline retreated early in the evening, a left-moving supercell organized in northwest Garza County and raced north-northeast at highway speeds for the next 2.5 hours accompanied by large hail up to golfball size and severe winds.  A second and more extensive round of thunderstorms emerged late on the 18th across the southwest South Plains as a Pacific cold front collided with the retreating dryline.  The result was an extensive squall line that at one point extended from the Oklahoma Panhandle south to the western Permian Basin. Strong low-level shear in the vicinity of this squall line resulted in the formation of at least three persistent, non-tornadic circulations as observed by the NWS-LBB WSR-88D. One of these circulations was sampled in high detail by research meteorologists from Texas Tech University near Reese Center using mobile Doppler radars and high resolution surface stations (sticknets). The mobile data collected suggests these vorticies were likely gustnadoes producing very localized winds up to 78 mph.

Despite the ferocious winds, only one power pole was downed in the area. Although NWS Lubbock radar indicated only marginal storm intensities during this time, the high winds were deemed legitimate based on the fact that cable ties to the mesonet tower were snapped. Farther southeast, a NWS COOP observer about ten miles south of Paducah reported a couple large tree limbs had snapped and damaged a fence.","Moist southerly surface winds this afternoon combined with an extension of upper level moisture originating from Tropical Depression Miriam in the Eastern Pacific.

An upper level low pressure lifted northeast out of the southwest U.S.  The upper level center, as well as the surface low, passed northwest of Iowa, across southeast South Dakota into Minnesota.  Severe weather developed north of the warm front as it lifted north into Iowa.  A cluster of severe storms formed over northeast Kansas and southeast Nebraska.  These storms moved east-northeast along the warm front into Iowa, causing a considerable amount of severe weather.  Severe weather parameters were fairly strong, however the dynamics of a 100 kt mid level jet and 60 kt low level jet made up the difference.  Just prior to the storm development, CAPE values were around 4000 J/kg south of the development.  Helicity was high, in the 300 to 500 range.  There was a large amount of effective shear with 50 to 65 kts available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere was in the 200 to 400 J/kg range, while downdraft CAPE was 600 to 800 J/kg.  Plenty of low level moisture was drawn into the state on the strong low level jet.  Precipitable water vales rose to 1.25 inches quite rapidly.  The LCL level was relatively high, but given the dynmics was relatively easy to overcome.  The LCL was just under 1000 meters at the beginning of the event.  There were three tornadoes reported during the event.  One was northwest of the Creston area in Union County.  The most significant tornado caused high end EF2 damage to the far northwest corner of Creston. This tornado formed southwest of Cromwell at 1752 CST in Adams county and quickly tracked into northwest Creston around 1800 CST. EF2 damage occurred to the Greater Regional Medical Center and the Southwestern Community College campus. The tornado continued tracking to the northeast and damaged several farmsteads northeast of Creston before dissipating about 10 miles northeast of town at approximately 1815 CST.  The wind strength was estimated to be 130 MPH. Significant damage occurred with uninsured damage alone near $2,000,000.  A tornado touched down in Warren County east of New Virginia.  The tornado caused damage to farm buildings and campers with a considerable amount of sheet metal left lying around.  The EF1 tornado produced winds around 100 MPH.  Many of the thunderstorms brought with them high winds and hail.  The final tornado touched down in Mahaska County.  The tornado was an EF1 tornado with a broad and intense rear flank downdraft south of the track.  The AWOS site at the Oskaloosa airport in Mahaska County recorded a 97 MPH wind gust from the rear flank downdraft of the storm. Reports from the Emergency Manager indicated that damage at the airport was limited to two hangar doors and some damage to airport buildings.  There were no planes on the field at the time. Numerous reports of hail larger than quarter size were received.  Some of the larger hail included baseball size hail in Clarke County at Murray and numerous reports of golf ball size hail along the track of the severe cluster from Union County to Mahaska County.  The same cluster of storms also produced very strong winds along its path.  Numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds were received all along the path.  Numerous reports of tree and power line damage were received.  The Des Moines metro area was hard hit with winds of up to 65 MPH causing considerable tree damage.  At one time, 20,000 customers were reported without power.  In Marion County a garage was destroyed and a house significantly damaged by the wind east of Knoxville.   The storms also produced very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was reported at several locations.  At the Des Moines International Airport, 1.10 inches of rain fell between 1630 and 1637 CST.  This amount of rainfall in that short of period of time was a 100 year event.

Feeding on a very unstable atmosphere  - cold and dry air well above the earth’s surface - initial storms would slam Zapata County during lunchtime with damaging wind, large hail, flooding rain, and frequent lightning. As the afternoon progressed, increasing contrast between cooler air across the South Texas Plains (60s and 70s) with the last of the early May heat in the Rio Grande Valley (90s) set the stage for additional storms with damaging winds and flooding rain in Zapata, and culminated with a monster supercell thunderstorm which cruised from southwest Brooks County through Raymondville before weakening.  This impressive supercell storm dominated the episode, and produced a measured instantaneous wind gust over 100 mph in rural Hidalgo County.

394069,6/29/2012 22:15,51,MG,A gust to 59 mph was measured from a compass heading of 320 degrees.,"On the second day of a developing heat wave, under a sunny sky, afternoon temperatures reached the upper 90s to above 100 degrees across most of southeast Ohio.  For example, Waterloo in Lawrence County reached 104 degrees that Friday afternoon.  Marietta had 100 degrees.  Meanwhile, an area of multi-cellular convection had moved out of northern Illinois that morning. It continued to organize and strengthen, as it propagated east and southeast across northern Indiana into western Ohio during the afternoon.  As it moved toward southeast Ohio, it had already formed into a large arch of storms, or bow, with a developing cool pool in its wake.  The temperature contrast between the air ahead of the developing derecho, compared to that in its wake was reaching 30 to 35 degrees. The resultant wind shift in the cool pool resulted in strong moisture convergence on the leading edge of the complex.  This in turn, helped drive the storms further southeast, away from the mid and upper level wind support.  However, the complex was diving right into that hot air that had obtained large convective available potential energy (CAPE), on the order of 4000 to 5000 j/kg.    The derecho reached southeast Ohio near the hottest time of the day, after 1600E.  It was racing southeast around 65 mph.  The outflow or gust front began to outrace the rain as it moved into southeast Ohio.  As the system matured, the strong gusts were longer in duration, in some cases around 10 minutes. That gust front then crossed the Ohio River into northeast Kentucky and western West Virginia on either side of 1730E.  The storms and showers only provided about a quarter to a half inch of rain.     Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely with the leading gust front across southeast Ohio.  A department of highways garage in Perry County measured 62 mph at 1650E.  Ohio University at Athens measured 64 mph at 1712E.  The airport near Albany of Athens County had a gust to 59 mph at 1715E.  The department of highways garage in Gallia County near Kerr had 62 mph at 1731E.  The wind caused trees and large branches to fall in scattered locations throughout the 9 counties in southeast Ohio.  There was some structural damage.  Corrugated metal and siding were ripped off a few buildings.  Trees fell onto houses and vehicles.  Out of the 9 counties only 4 counties reported individual damage to the state.  Those counties were Athens, Jackson, Lawrence and Meigs.  The fallen trees and power lines also caused roads to be temporarily blocked.  However, the largest impact was on the electric power grid.  Prolonged power outages occurred.  Some areas were without electricity for 4 to 7 days.    Luckily there were no direct deaths or injuries.  One indirect death can be attributed to the storm.   The lack of electricity in the midst of the heat wave, disrupted the daily routines of most citizens for several days.  Water and ice were in high demand. An emergency declaration by President Obama allowed federal supplies to be quickly delivered.  Family and retail refrigerated food lost was substantial. Rural citizens with private wells may have been hit harder than those living in towns on public water systems.  Citizens that relied on well water had no power to pump the water from their wells.  Water had to be hauled just to flush the toilet. Some people slept outside on porches where it was cooler.  With limited gas stations available to pump gas, long lines developed for a few days in the wake of the storm.  Workers trying to restore the electricity had to take frequent breaks due to the heat and the safety equipment they had to wear.  Due to the public damage, a federal major disaster was eventually declared for this episode.  A few others episodes during the first few days of July were also included.  See FEMA disaster number 4077 for more details.",39.22,-82.23
394834,6/29/2012 22:56,51,MG,A gust to 59 mph was measured from 350 degrees on the compass.,"On the second day of a developing heat wave, under a sunny sky, afternoon temperatures reached record levels.  The lowlands saw thermometers reach into the upper 90s and above 100 degrees.  For example, both Huntington and Charleston had 103 degrees. Parkersburg and Clarksburg had 98 degrees.  Even the mountainous regions reached into the 90s.  Beckley and Elkins reached 96 degrees.   Meanwhile, an area of multi-cellular convection had moved out of northern Illinois that morning. It continued to organize and strengthen, as it propagated east and southeast across northern Indiana into western Ohio during the afternoon.  As it moved toward southeast Ohio, it had already formed into a large arch of storms, or bow, with a developing cool pool in its wake.

This in turn, helped drive the storms further southeast, away from the mid and upper level wind support.  However, the complex was diving right into that hot air that had obtained large convective available potential energy, or the order of 4000 to 5000 j/kg.    The complex streaked across southeast Ohio near the hottest time of the day and plowed into western West Virginia near 1730E.  The outflow, or gust front, had outraced the rain, as it moved through southeast Ohio.  That gust front then moved southeast at 60 to 65 mph across West Virginia.  The mature derecho caused the strong gusts to be longer in duration than found in most severe thunderstorms. In some cases the strong wind gusts lasted around 10 minutes. Due to the dry ground,  dust and debris accompanied the gust front in some areas. The storms and showers that followed the strong wind gusts only provided about a quarter to a half inch of rain.  A few areas even had less rain.      Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were likely with the leading gust front, before weakening in the southern coal fields of West Virginia.  A few favored and exposed locations may have seen gusts around 90 mph. Locations sheltered from the northwest had gusts less than 60 mph. The strongest measured gust was 77 mph from the Charleston airport at 1810E.  The Huntington airport had a gust to 59 mph at 1758E.  The Clarksburg airport had a gust to 66 mph at 1828E.  The Elkins airport had a gust to 64 mph at 1857E.  The Beckley airport had a gust to 68 mph at 1907E.  A spotter in Weston reported a gust to 73 mph on their private equipment.  Likewise, a spotter in Mason County reported a gust to 62 mph.     The wind caused numerous trees and large branches to fall in scattered locations throughout most counties.  Luckily, there were no direct deaths.  There were 3 indirect deaths that followed from the storms.  There was only one direct injury.  There was structural damage.  Corrugated metal and siding were ripped off buildings.  Trees fell onto houses or vehicles.  Overall though, there was not a lot of physical damage to individual property. The fallen trees and power lines also caused roads to be temporarily blocked.  However, the largest impact of the high winds was on the electric power grid.  Prolong power outages occurred as the heat wave continued during the first week of July.  The workers restoring the electricity had to take frequent breaks due to the heat and the safety equipment they had to wear. The electric utility companies had regional transmission lines damaged.  These had to be repaired in addition to the usual distribution system.  One electric company had to replace over 1000 poles, 575 transformers and 172 miles of wire.  That total does include a few counties outside of West Virginia.   The lack of electricity in the midst of the heat wave, disrupted the daily routines of most citizens for several days.  The word, derecho, was introduced into many  everyday conversations.  Water and ice were in high demand.  Family and retail refrigerated food lost was substantial. An emergency declaration by President Obama allowed the federal government to quickly deliver nearly 300 truckloads of water and 750,000 meals.  The federal government also shipped over 100 industrial sized generators for critical infrastructure use.  Some people slept outside on porches where it was cooler.  With limited gas stations available to pump gas, long lines developed for a few days in the wake of the storm.  Phone and water service were also affected.  Telephone companies had to use emergency generators to power cell towers.  Likewise, water companies had to find power for their pumping stations.  Citizens that relied on well water had no power to pump the water from their wells.   Around 600 state natural guard troops performed wellness checks, delivered food and water, and helped in clearing away the fallen trees.  Mainly due to the public damage, a federal major disaster was eventually declared for this episode.  A few others episodes in early July were also included.

For example, Waterloo in Lawrence County reached 104 degrees that Friday afternoon.  Marietta had 100 degrees.  Meanwhile, an area of multi-cellular convection had moved out of northern Illinois that morning. It continued to organize and strengthen, as it propagated east and southeast across northern Indiana into western Ohio during the afternoon.  As it moved toward southeast Ohio, it had already formed into a large arch of storms, or bow, with a developing cool pool in its wake.  The temperature contrast between the air ahead of the developing derecho, compared to that in its wake was reaching 30 to 35 degrees. The resultant wind shift in the cool pool resulted in strong moisture convergence on the leading edge of the complex.  This in turn, helped drive the storms further southeast, away from the mid and upper level wind support.  However, the complex was diving right into that hot air that had obtained large convective available potential energy (CAPE), on the order of 4000 to 5000 j/kg.    The derecho reached southeast Ohio near the hottest time of the day, after 1600E.  It was racing southeast around 65 mph.  The outflow or gust front began to outrace the rain as it moved into southeast Ohio.  As the system matured, the strong gusts were longer in duration, in some cases around 10 minutes. That gust front then crossed the Ohio River into northeast Kentucky and western West Virginia on either side of 1730E.  The storms and showers only provided about a quarter to a half inch of rain.     Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely with the leading gust front across southeast Ohio.

Corrugated metal and siding were ripped off a few buildings.  Trees fell onto houses and vehicles.  Out of the 9 counties only 4 counties reported individual damage to the state.  Those counties were Athens, Jackson, Lawrence and Meigs.  The fallen trees and power lines also caused roads to be temporarily blocked.  However, the largest impact was on the electric power grid.  Prolonged power outages occurred.  Some areas were without electricity for 4 to 7 days.    Luckily there were no direct deaths or injuries.  One indirect death can be attributed to the storm.

However, the complex was diving right into that hot air that had obtained large convective available potential energy, or the order of 4000 to 5000 j/kg.    The complex streaked across southeast Ohio near the hottest time of the day and plowed into western West Virginia near 1730E.  The outflow, or gust front, had outraced the rain, as it moved through southeast Ohio.  That gust front then moved southeast at 60 to 65 mph across West Virginia.  The mature derecho caused the strong gusts to be longer in duration than found in most severe thunderstorms. In some cases the strong wind gusts lasted around 10 minutes. Due to the dry ground,  dust and debris accompanied the gust front in some areas. The storms and showers that followed the strong wind gusts only provided about a quarter to a half inch of rain.  A few areas even had less rain.      Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were likely with the leading gust front, before weakening in the southern coal fields of West Virginia.  A few favored and exposed locations may have seen gusts around 90 mph. Locations sheltered from the northwest had gusts less than 60 mph.

The Elkins airport had a gust to 64 mph at 1857E.  The Beckley airport had a gust to 68 mph at 1907E.  A spotter in Weston reported a gust to 73 mph on their private equipment.  Likewise, a spotter in Mason County reported a gust to 62 mph.     The wind caused numerous trees and large branches to fall in scattered locations throughout most counties.  Luckily, there were no direct deaths.  There were 3 indirect deaths that followed from the storms.  There was only one direct injury.  There was structural damage.  Corrugated metal and siding were ripped off buildings.  Trees fell onto houses or vehicles.  Overall though, there was not a lot of physical damage to individual property. The fallen trees and power lines also caused roads to be temporarily blocked.  However, the largest impact of the high winds was on the electric power grid.  Prolong power outages occurred as the heat wave continued during the first week of July.  The workers restoring the electricity had to take frequent breaks due to the heat and the safety equipment they had to wear. The electric utility companies had regional transmission lines damaged.  These had to be repaired in addition to the usual distribution system.  One electric company had to replace over 1000 poles, 575 transformers and 172 miles of wire.  That total does include a few counties outside of West Virginia.   The lack of electricity in the midst of the heat wave, disrupted the daily routines of most citizens for several days.  The word, derecho, was introduced into many  everyday conversations.  Water and ice were in high demand.  Family and retail refrigerated food lost was substantial. An emergency declaration by President Obama allowed the federal government to quickly deliver nearly 300 truckloads of water and 750,000 meals.  The federal government also shipped over 100 industrial sized generators for critical infrastructure use.  Some people slept outside on porches where it was cooler.  With limited gas stations available to pump gas, long lines developed for a few days in the wake of the storm.  Phone and water service were also affected.  Telephone companies had to use emergency generators to power cell towers.  Likewise, water companies had to find power for their pumping stations.  Citizens that relied on well water had no power to pump the water from their wells.   Around 600 state natural guard troops performed wellness checks, delivered food and water, and helped in clearing away the fallen trees.  Mainly due to the public damage, a federal major disaster was eventually declared for this episode.  A few others episodes in early July were also included.

391230,6/29/2012 21:53,56,MG,nan,"An anomalously strong ridge centered across the Southeast brought record heat to the Upper Ohio Valley with the area in a zonal flow on the northern edge of the ridge. A weak frontal boundary extended from northern Indiana into western Pennsylvania.  Abundant moisture (1.75-2.00 PWAT), strong instability (SBCAPE 4000-5000 J/kg), moderate shear (40kts 0-6km), and a short wave just south of the boundary provided the ingredients for a long-tracked mesoscale convective system, classified by the Storm Prediction Center as a derecho, to track all the way from northern Indiana across eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, northern WV, and western Maryland. As the MCS crossed the area, widespread wind damage was reported across areas primarily south and west of Pittsburgh. There were several reports of structural damage and damage led to a fatality when a barn collapsed in Muskingum county. Power outages were widespread with up to 130,000 outages reported immediately after the storms passage, most of which, were in Ohio. Muskingum and Guernsey counties sustained $712,000 and $500,000 in damages respectively. This also became on of the the costliest disasters to hit Ohio, right behind Hurricane Ike in 2008.",39.96,-81.9
394070,6/29/2012 22:12,56,MG,A gust to 64 mph was measured.  The Ohio University campus lost 25 trees to the wind.  The trees damaged a baseball field fence and crushed one truck.,"On the second day of a developing heat wave, under a sunny sky, afternoon temperatures reached the upper 90s to above 100 degrees across most of southeast Ohio.  For example, Waterloo in Lawrence County reached 104 degrees that Friday afternoon.  Marietta had 100 degrees.  Meanwhile, an area of multi-cellular convection had moved out of northern Illinois that morning. It continued to organize and strengthen, as it propagated east and southeast across northern Indiana into western Ohio during the afternoon.  As it moved toward southeast Ohio, it had already formed into a large arch of storms, or bow, with a developing cool pool in its wake.  The temperature contrast between the air ahead of the developing derecho, compared to that in its wake was reaching 30 to 35 degrees. The resultant wind shift in the cool pool resulted in strong moisture convergence on the leading edge of the complex.  This in turn, helped drive the storms further southeast, away from the mid and upper level wind support.  However, the complex was diving right into that hot air that had obtained large convective available potential energy (CAPE), on the order of 4000 to 5000 j/kg.    The derecho reached southeast Ohio near the hottest time of the day, after 1600E.  It was racing southeast around 65 mph.  The outflow or gust front began to outrace the rain as it moved into southeast Ohio.  As the system matured, the strong gusts were longer in duration, in some cases around 10 minutes. That gust front then crossed the Ohio River into northeast Kentucky and western West Virginia on either side of 1730E.  The storms and showers only provided about a quarter to a half inch of rain.     Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely with the leading gust front across southeast Ohio.  A department of highways garage in Perry County measured 62 mph at 1650E.  Ohio University at Athens measured 64 mph at 1712E.  The airport near Albany of Athens County had a gust to 59 mph at 1715E.  The department of highways garage in Gallia County near Kerr had 62 mph at 1731E.  The wind caused trees and large branches to fall in scattered locations throughout the 9 counties in southeast Ohio.  There was some structural damage.  Corrugated metal and siding were ripped off a few buildings.  Trees fell onto houses and vehicles.  Out of the 9 counties only 4 counties reported individual damage to the state.  Those counties were Athens, Jackson, Lawrence and Meigs.  The fallen trees and power lines also caused roads to be temporarily blocked.  However, the largest impact was on the electric power grid.  Prolonged power outages occurred.  Some areas were without electricity for 4 to 7 days.    Luckily there were no direct deaths or injuries.  One indirect death can be attributed to the storm.   The lack of electricity in the midst of the heat wave, disrupted the daily routines of most citizens for several days.  Water and ice were in high demand. An emergency declaration by President Obama allowed federal supplies to be quickly delivered.  Family and retail refrigerated food lost was substantial. Rural citizens with private wells may have been hit harder than those living in towns on public water systems.  Citizens that relied on well water had no power to pump the water from their wells.  Water had to be hauled just to flush the toilet. Some people slept outside on porches where it was cooler.  With limited gas stations available to pump gas, long lines developed for a few days in the wake of the storm.  Workers trying to restore the electricity had to take frequent breaks due to the heat and the safety equipment they had to wear.  Due to the public damage, a federal major disaster was eventually declared for this episode.  A few others episodes during the first few days of July were also included.

391238,6/29/2012 22:00,59,MG,nan,"An anomalously strong ridge centered across the Southeast brought record heat to the Upper Ohio Valley with the area in a zonal flow on the northern edge of the ridge. A weak frontal boundary extended from northern Indiana into western Pennsylvania.  Abundant moisture (1.75-2.00 PWAT), strong instability (SBCAPE 4000-5000 J/kg), moderate shear (40kts 0-6km), and a short wave just south of the boundary provided the ingredients for a long-tracked mesoscale convective system, classified by the Storm Prediction Center as a derecho, to track all the way from northern Indiana across eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, northern WV, and western Maryland. As the MCS crossed the area, widespread wind damage was reported across areas primarily south and west of Pittsburgh.

The storms became more organized as they tracked through central Ohio. The complex of storms developed into a derecho as it tracked through Ohio and into West Virginia and Virginia. The resulting system produced a large area of damaging winds. As the derecho tracked through the northern portion of Kentucky, a gust front was produced and tracked south across eastern Kentucky. Numerous reports of wind damage was recieved as the gust front pushed south.",38.06,-83.75
394838,6/30/2012 0:07,59,MG,A gust to 68 mph was measured from 350 degrees on the compass.,"On the second day of a developing heat wave, under a sunny sky, afternoon temperatures reached record levels.  The lowlands saw thermometers reach into the upper 90s and above 100 degrees.  For example, both Huntington and Charleston had 103 degrees. Parkersburg and Clarksburg had 98 degrees.  Even the mountainous regions reached into the 90s.  Beckley and Elkins reached 96 degrees.   Meanwhile, an area of multi-cellular convection had moved out of northern Illinois that morning. It continued to organize and strengthen, as it propagated east and southeast across northern Indiana into western Ohio during the afternoon.  As it moved toward southeast Ohio, it had already formed into a large arch of storms, or bow, with a developing cool pool in its wake.  The temperature contrast between the air ahead of the developing derecho, compared to that in its wake was reaching 30 to 35 degrees. The resultant wind shift in the cool pool resulted in strong moisture convergence on the leading edge of the complex.  This in turn, helped drive the storms further southeast, away from the mid and upper level wind support.  However, the complex was diving right into that hot air that had obtained large convective available potential energy, or the order of 4000 to 5000 j/kg.    The complex streaked across southeast Ohio near the hottest time of the day and plowed into western West Virginia near 1730E.  The outflow, or gust front, had outraced the rain, as it moved through southeast Ohio.  That gust front then moved southeast at 60 to 65 mph across West Virginia.  The mature derecho caused the strong gusts to be longer in duration than found in most severe thunderstorms. In some cases the strong wind gusts lasted around 10 minutes. Due to the dry ground,  dust and debris accompanied the gust front in some areas. The storms and showers that followed the strong wind gusts only provided about a quarter to a half inch of rain.  A few areas even had less rain.      Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were likely with the leading gust front, before weakening in the southern coal fields of West Virginia.  A few favored and exposed locations may have seen gusts around 90 mph. Locations sheltered from the northwest had gusts less than 60 mph. The strongest measured gust was 77 mph from the Charleston airport at 1810E.  The Huntington airport had a gust to 59 mph at 1758E.  The Clarksburg airport had a gust to 66 mph at 1828E.  The Elkins airport had a gust to 64 mph at 1857E.  The Beckley airport had a gust to 68 mph at 1907E.  A spotter in Weston reported a gust to 73 mph on their private equipment.  Likewise, a spotter in Mason County reported a gust to 62 mph.     The wind caused numerous trees and large branches to fall in scattered locations throughout most counties.  Luckily, there were no direct deaths.  There were 3 indirect deaths that followed from the storms.  There was only one direct injury.  There was structural damage.  Corrugated metal and siding were ripped off buildings.  Trees fell onto houses or vehicles.  Overall though, there was not a lot of physical damage to individual property. The fallen trees and power lines also caused roads to be temporarily blocked.  However, the largest impact of the high winds was on the electric power grid.  Prolong power outages occurred as the heat wave continued during the first week of July.  The workers restoring the electricity had to take frequent breaks due to the heat and the safety equipment they had to wear. The electric utility companies had regional transmission lines damaged.  These had to be repaired in addition to the usual distribution system.  One electric company had to replace over 1000 poles, 575 transformers and 172 miles of wire.  That total does include a few counties outside of West Virginia.   The lack of electricity in the midst of the heat wave, disrupted the daily routines of most citizens for several days.  The word, derecho, was introduced into many  everyday conversations.  Water and ice were in high demand.  Family and retail refrigerated food lost was substantial. An emergency declaration by President Obama allowed the federal government to quickly deliver nearly 300 truckloads of water and 750,000 meals.  The federal government also shipped over 100 industrial sized generators for critical infrastructure use.  Some people slept outside on porches where it was cooler.  With limited gas stations available to pump gas, long lines developed for a few days in the wake of the storm.  Phone and water service were also affected.  Telephone companies had to use emergency generators to power cell towers.  Likewise, water companies had to find power for their pumping stations.  Citizens that relied on well water had no power to pump the water from their wells.   Around 600 state natural guard troops performed wellness checks, delivered food and water, and helped in clearing away the fallen trees.  Mainly due to the public damage, a federal major disaster was eventually declared for this episode.  A few others episodes in early July were also included.

394812,6/29/2012 23:30,63,MG,A gust to 73 mph was measured by private equipment.  Large trees were blown down.,"On the second day of a developing heat wave, under a sunny sky, afternoon temperatures reached record levels.  The lowlands saw thermometers reach into the upper 90s and above 100 degrees.  For example, both Huntington and Charleston had 103 degrees. Parkersburg and Clarksburg had 98 degrees.  Even the mountainous regions reached into the 90s.  Beckley and Elkins reached 96 degrees.   Meanwhile, an area of multi-cellular convection had moved out of northern Illinois that morning. It continued to organize and strengthen, as it propagated east and southeast across northern Indiana into western Ohio during the afternoon.  As it moved toward southeast Ohio, it had already formed into a large arch of storms, or bow, with a developing cool pool in its wake.  The temperature contrast between the air ahead of the developing derecho, compared to that in its wake was reaching 30 to 35 degrees. The resultant wind shift in the cool pool resulted in strong moisture convergence on the leading edge of the complex.  This in turn, helped drive the storms further southeast, away from the mid and upper level wind support.  However, the complex was diving right into that hot air that had obtained large convective available potential energy, or the order of 4000 to 5000 j/kg.    The complex streaked across southeast Ohio near the hottest time of the day and plowed into western West Virginia near 1730E.  The outflow, or gust front, had outraced the rain, as it moved through southeast Ohio.  That gust front then moved southeast at 60 to 65 mph across West Virginia.  The mature derecho caused the strong gusts to be longer in duration than found in most severe thunderstorms. In some cases the strong wind gusts lasted around 10 minutes. Due to the dry ground,  dust and debris accompanied the gust front in some areas. The storms and showers that followed the strong wind gusts only provided about a quarter to a half inch of rain.  A few areas even had less rain.      Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were likely with the leading gust front, before weakening in the southern coal fields of West Virginia.  A few favored and exposed locations may have seen gusts around 90 mph. Locations sheltered from the northwest had gusts less than 60 mph. The strongest measured gust was 77 mph from the Charleston airport at 1810E.  The Huntington airport had a gust to 59 mph at 1758E.  The Clarksburg airport had a gust to 66 mph at 1828E.  The Elkins airport had a gust to 64 mph at 1857E.  The Beckley airport had a gust to 68 mph at 1907E.  A spotter in Weston reported a gust to 73 mph on their private equipment.  Likewise, a spotter in Mason County reported a gust to 62 mph.     The wind caused numerous trees and large branches to fall in scattered locations throughout most counties.  Luckily, there were no direct deaths.  There were 3 indirect deaths that followed from the storms.  There was only one direct injury.  There was structural damage.  Corrugated metal and siding were ripped off buildings.  Trees fell onto houses or vehicles.  Overall though, there was not a lot of physical damage to individual property. The fallen trees and power lines also caused roads to be temporarily blocked.  However, the largest impact of the high winds was on the electric power grid.  Prolong power outages occurred as the heat wave continued during the first week of July.  The workers restoring the electricity had to take frequent breaks due to the heat and the safety equipment they had to wear. The electric utility companies had regional transmission lines damaged.  These had to be repaired in addition to the usual distribution system.  One electric company had to replace over 1000 poles, 575 transformers and 172 miles of wire.  That total does include a few counties outside of West Virginia.   The lack of electricity in the midst of the heat wave, disrupted the daily routines of most citizens for several days.  The word, derecho, was introduced into many  everyday conversations.  Water and ice were in high demand.  Family and retail refrigerated food lost was substantial. An emergency declaration by President Obama allowed the federal government to quickly deliver nearly 300 truckloads of water and 750,000 meals.  The federal government also shipped over 100 industrial sized generators for critical infrastructure use.  Some people slept outside on porches where it was cooler.  With limited gas stations available to pump gas, long lines developed for a few days in the wake of the storm.  Phone and water service were also affected.  Telephone companies had to use emergency generators to power cell towers.  Likewise, water companies had to find power for their pumping stations.  Citizens that relied on well water had no power to pump the water from their wells.   Around 600 state natural guard troops performed wellness checks, delivered food and water, and helped in clearing away the fallen trees.  Mainly due to the public damage, a federal major disaster was eventually declared for this episode.  A few others episodes in early July were also included.  See FEMA disaster number 4071 for more details.",39.03,-80.45

394825,6/29/2012 23:10,67,MG,A gust to 77 mph was recorded from 330 degrees on the compass.  A hanger was damaged.  A small single engine plane flipped over on the tarmac.,"On the second day of a developing heat wave, under a sunny sky, afternoon temperatures reached record levels.  The lowlands saw thermometers reach into the upper 90s and above 100 degrees.  For example, both Huntington and Charleston had 103 degrees. Parkersburg and Clarksburg had 98 degrees.  Even the mountainous regions reached into the 90s.  Beckley and Elkins reached 96 degrees.   Meanwhile, an area of multi-cellular convection had moved out of northern Illinois that morning. It continued to organize and strengthen, as it propagated east and southeast across northern Indiana into western Ohio during the afternoon.  As it moved toward southeast Ohio, it had already formed into a large arch of storms, or bow, with a developing cool pool in its wake.  The temperature contrast between the air ahead of the developing derecho, compared to that in its wake was reaching 30 to 35 degrees. The resultant wind shift in the cool pool resulted in strong moisture convergence on the leading edge of the complex.  This in turn, helped drive the storms further southeast, away from the mid and upper level wind support.  However, the complex was diving right into that hot air that had obtained large convective available potential energy, or the order of 4000 to 5000 j/kg.    The complex streaked across southeast Ohio near the hottest time of the day and plowed into western West Virginia near 1730E.  The outflow, or gust front, had outraced the rain, as it moved through southeast Ohio.  That gust front then moved southeast at 60 to 65 mph across West Virginia.  The mature derecho caused the strong gusts to be longer in duration than found in most severe thunderstorms. In some cases the strong wind gusts lasted around 10 minutes. Due to the dry ground,  dust and debris accompanied the gust front in some areas. The storms and showers that followed the strong wind gusts only provided about a quarter to a half inch of rain.  A few areas even had less rain.      Widespread wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were likely with the leading gust front, before weakening in the southern coal fields of West Virginia.  A few favored and exposed locations may have seen gusts around 90 mph. Locations sheltered from the northwest had gusts less than 60 mph. The strongest measured gust was 77 mph from the Charleston airport at 1810E.  The Huntington airport had a gust to 59 mph at 1758E.  The Clarksburg airport had a gust to 66 mph at 1828E.  The Elkins airport had a gust to 64 mph at 1857E.  The Beckley airport had a gust to 68 mph at 1907E.  A spotter in Weston reported a gust to 73 mph on their private equipment.  Likewise, a spotter in Mason County reported a gust to 62 mph.     The wind caused numerous trees and large branches to fall in scattered locations throughout most counties.  Luckily, there were no direct deaths.  There were 3 indirect deaths that followed from the storms.  There was only one direct injury.  There was structural damage.  Corrugated metal and siding were ripped off buildings.  Trees fell onto houses or vehicles.  Overall though, there was not a lot of physical damage to individual property. The fallen trees and power lines also caused roads to be temporarily blocked.  However, the largest impact of the high winds was on the electric power grid.  Prolong power outages occurred as the heat wave continued during the first week of July.  The workers restoring the electricity had to take frequent breaks due to the heat and the safety equipment they had to wear. The electric utility companies had regional transmission lines damaged.  These had to be repaired in addition to the usual distribution system.  One electric company had to replace over 1000 poles, 575 transformers and 172 miles of wire.  That total does include a few counties outside of West Virginia.   The lack of electricity in the midst of the heat wave, disrupted the daily routines of most citizens for several days.  The word, derecho, was introduced into many  everyday conversations.  Water and ice were in high demand.  Family and retail refrigerated food lost was substantial. An emergency declaration by President Obama allowed the federal government to quickly deliver nearly 300 truckloads of water and 750,000 meals.  The federal government also shipped over 100 industrial sized generators for critical infrastructure use.  Some people slept outside on porches where it was cooler.  With limited gas stations available to pump gas, long lines developed for a few days in the wake of the storm.  Phone and water service were also affected.  Telephone companies had to use emergency generators to power cell towers.  Likewise, water companies had to find power for their pumping stations.  Citizens that relied on well water had no power to pump the water from their wells.   Around 600 state natural guard troops performed wellness checks, delivered food and water, and helped in clearing away the fallen trees.  Mainly due to the public damage, a federal major disaster was eventually declared for this episode.  A few others episodes in early July were also included.  See FEMA disaster number 4071 for more details.",38.37,-81.6

This derecho produced widespread, significant wind damage from southern New Jersey southward into the Delmarva during the late evening and overnight of the 29th. Salem, Cumberland and Atlantic Counties were hit the hardest. The counties were battered by the derecho which downed trees, power lines and poles, sparked fires and destroyed some homes.  There were three storm related deaths, two boys camping in Salem County and a man whose boat capsized in Absecon Bay in Atlantic County. A preliminary damage assessment put the cost at around $20 million for the three counties.  In all sixteen homes were destroyed, ninety-two suffered major damage, one hundred eighty-seven suffered minor damage and another one hundred and twelve were affected by the derecho. In addition, forty-one businesses suffered major damage and three hundred twenty-nine suffered minor damage. A state of emergency was declared in Atlantic County. Governor Chris Christie mobilized the National Guard to help provide fuel and water. President Barack Obama has issued a disaster declaration for parts of South Jersey in the wake of the derecho.  The president ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Atlantic, Cumberland and Salem counties. Federal funds will be available to state and local governments and certain nonprofit private organizations.  Atlantic City Electric reported 206,000 of its customers lost power; 105,000 of the homes and businesses were in Atlantic County.  On Sunday July 1st, 119,000 of its customers were still without power.  The utility restored power to its last customers on July 11th.  Meanwhile in Cumberland County, Vineland Electric expected its remaining 1,800 customers that lost power to have it restored during the week of July 9th.  Strong thunderstorm development began across the Midwest and Lower Great Lakes regions during the afternoon of the 29th, with storms initiating across northern Illinois, near Chicago.  Strong mid-level winds and an unstable airmass contributed to rapid development as well-organized storms progressed from northern Illinois through Indiana and Ohio.  This robust convection continued to track southeastward into an airmass that was even more unstable due to abundant daytime surface heating.  Late afternoon temperatures had peaked mainly in the mid to upper 90s with high humidity throughout the Mid Atlantic states, and as the potent thunderstorm cluster progressed from the Great Lakes to the central Appalachians and into the Mid Atlantic by late evening, thunderstorm activity was reinvigorated.    A robust gust front outpaced the main thunderstorm line, producing strong wind gusts as it traveled from the eastern shore of Maryland into Delaware and southern New Jersey. Shortly thereafter, the potent thunderstorm line tracked through the region, with additional damaging wind gusts. One cell in particular around Baltimore, MD experienced rapid intensification and expansion as it raced eastward into northern Delaware and southern New Jersey. This massive cell produced extreme damage throughout Salem, Cumberland, and Atlantic Counties in New Jersey. Damage to trees, power lines, and buildings was also significant throughout Delaware and the eastern shore of Maryland. Thunderstorms also dropped hail in several locations, ranging from penny to golf-ball size.

Locations impacted by the storms included but were not limited to:  Aurora, Castle Rock, Centennial, Highlands Ranch, Lone Tree, Parker, Surrey Ridge.  The storms produced a barrage of large hail, damaging straight line winds, flash flooding and several short lived tornadoes.  The hail ranged in size from 1 to 2 inches in diameter, and caused extensive damage to homes and automobiles.  The hail inundated the roadways with several inches of hail in Douglas County.  Consequently, snow plows had to be called out to clear the roadways. One tornado that touched down near Grover in Weld County ripped a tree from the ground and tossed it approximately twenty feet.    The combination of torrential hail and heavy rain produced flash flooding in parts of Elbert, Douglas and Arapahoe Counties, as thunderstorms brought up to 3.35 inches of rain to some areas within 90 minutes.  In Aurora, Picadilly Road was closed from flooding north of 6th Avenue.  A water rescue took place on South Gun Club Road in Arapahoe County, where floodwaters were rushing to depth of 3 feet.  Flash flooding forced the closure of several streets and roads from Parker south to The Pinery, where the floodwaters inundated the roadway with up to 2 feet in several locations.  At Centennial Airport in Arapahoe County, a historic B-17 Flying Fortress suffered extensive damage as hailstones as large as ping pong balls hit the aircraft. Although the airframe itself did not require repair, the fabric-covered ailerons and elevators were extensively damaged.  The hail came straight down and punched holes in the fabric-covered control surfaces.  The plane landed just hours before the storm hit to participate in the weekend tour stop.

No damage was reported.,"The upper-level ridge that was over California at the end of August began to give way to an approaching east-Pacific upper-level trough. The trough brought an influx of marine air into the San Joaquin Valley, dropping temperatures well below normal. Both Bakersfield and Fresno only reached highs of 88 degrees on September 1st.  The marine air remained over the San Joaquin Valley through the 2nd, keeping temperatures across much of the central and southern San Joaquin Valley below normal. The trough lifted northeast on September 3rd, allowing temperatures to warm rapidly. Fresno saw a return of triple-digit heat on the 4th, while Bakersfield reached a high of 99. The next day saw tropical moisture from the remnants of former Hurricane Ileana bring a few showers as far north as the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. Clouds over the southern part of the Hanford warning/forecast area kept nights warm and daytime highs well below normal. On September 5th, the high at Bakersfield only reached 87 degrees, after a low of 74 the previous day. On the 6th, the high at Taft was only 89 degrees.  The tropical moisture triggered thunderstorms over the mountains and deserts that started during the morning of September 5th, with a few showers pushing into the southern San Joaquin Valley. Bakersfield reported a trace of rain during the early afternoon of September 5th, and again during the middle of the afternoon on the 6th. By the late afternoon of September 5th, thunderstorms had moved into Merced County, and during the evening a spotter in Ponderosa Basin (Mariposa County) reported a dry thunderstorm in progress.  The morning of September 7th saw a significant non-meteorological event affect the central and southern San Joaquin Valley. A pair of earthquakes, both approximately magnitude 4 on the Richter scale, occurred at 6:2:10 AM PDT and 6:23:48 AM PDT. Both were centered about 9 miles north-northeast of Avenal and were felt as far as Hanford. No damage was reported from either quake.  The upper-level ridge over the southwestern United States began building into California on the 7th. This pushed mid and high level clouds from another tropical system, John, northward as the clouds wrapped around the periphery of the ridge. A trough off the coast kept the ridge in check for the next several days, resulting in only minor fluctuations in high temperatures. Bakersfield had a high of 95 degrees on September 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th, and the high on the 11th was 96 degrees.  Monsoonal moisture surged into central California from the south, bringing thunderstorms to the mountains of Kern and Tulare Counties, and the Kern County deserts, during the afternoon and evening of September 8th, and again the next day. The thunderstorms on September 9th were stronger than those of the 8th. One midday thunderstorm dropped 0.50 inch of rain on Ponderosa in Tulare County. Another midday thunderstorm gave Frazier Park 0.14 inch of rain.  Thunderstorms continued to develop over the southern parts of the Hanford warning/forecast area on September 10th. A late- afternoon thunderstorm over Edwards Air Force Base produced outflow winds that gusted to 58 mph. A Severe Thunderstorm Warning had been issued for that storm 34 minutes before the gusts occurred.  An upper-level trough moved into California on September 12th. The southwesterly flow aloft ahead of the trough kept thunderstorms confined to near the Southern Sierra Nevada crest. The trough quickly moved through California, allowing an upper-level ridge to move into the state behind the trough.  The ridge strengthened over the state on September 13th, bringing both Bakersfield and Fresno a four-day stretch of triple-digit highs. September 14th was the hottest day of the stretch, with Fresno setting a record high of 106 degrees and just missing its record high minimum temperature by one degree.  The ridge began weakening on September 17th, resulting in a deepening of the marine layer along the coast. Marine air spilled into the central and southern San Joaquin Valley. September 18th saw Bakersfield and Fresno only reach highs of 92 degrees, with both cities remaining in the lower to mid 90s the next several days.  September 21st saw the central California interior between an upper-level ridge to the south and a short-wave along the coast to the north. This set up a southwest flow aloft which streamed mid and high clouds into the central California interior during the day and continuing overnight. The clouds began clearing out during the day on the 22nd, but lingered over Kern County. As a result, Fresno reached a high of 97 on the 22nd, which Bakersfield only reached 92 degrees.  Temperatures in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley—south of Merced County—warmed the next day, with both Bakersfield and Fresno seeing a return of triple-digit heat. This was the result of a weak downslope southeast wind over much of the San Joaquin Valley, which warmed the Valley floor. High clouds associated with an upper-level trough moving through the Pacific Northwest kept Merced near persistence, but highs in the upper 90s to 103 were reported south of Merced County.  An upper-level low moved through Oregon on September 23rd and dropped into eastern Nevada the next day. As the associated trough moved through California, the marine layer deepened along the coast and cool marine air spilled into the San Joaquin Valley. Temperatures cooled several degrees, with Merced and Los Banos only reaching the upper 80s while Bakersfield reached 97 degrees and Wasco reported 100. The trough also brought gusty winds to the Kern County mountains and deserts during the afternoon of the 24th, with gusts as high as 53 mph.  With marine air in place over the San Joaquin Valley, highs on September 25th were only in the upper 80s to lower 90s. After a prolonged period of above-normal temperatures, the 25th finally saw temperatures cool to near normal. The respite from the heat was short-lived, as the upper-level ridge rebuilt into California over the few days of the month. Some monsoonal moisture wrapping around the ridge brought isolated thunderstorms to the high country of the Southern Sierra Nevada during the afternoon of September 28th, with Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park reporting 0.02 inch of rain.  An upper-level short-wave that moved through the Pacific Northwest on September 29th weakened the ridge and lowered temperatures a few degrees, but central and southern San Joaquin Valley highs topped out in the lower to mid 90s, several degrees above the normal of upper 80s.  The short-wave moved into the northern Rocky Mountains on September 30th. This allowed the ridge to resume building over the central California interior. At the surface, a light offshore flow brought early-morning warming to the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. This set the stage for September to end with temperatures well above normal. Fresno had its hottest September on record, and Bakersfield had its sixth hottest September on record. Temperature records for both cities go back more than 120 years.",34.91,-117.93
410774,8/13/2012 0:30,50,MG,A thunderstorm created severe outflow winds in Mojave.,"The upper-level ridge centered over the Four Corners region built westward into California on August 6th, heralding the start of a near-record string of days with above-normal temperatures. After two days with highs of 99, Fresno again had a triple-digit high, the first of 19 consecutive days when the high was 100 degrees or higher. An Excessive Heat Watch was issued on the 7th for elevations below 4000 feet from August 10th through the 12th for near-record high temperatures.  Monsoonal moisture wrapping around the ridge moved into California, triggering thunderstorms over the Southern Sierra Nevada and the Kern County desert on August 9th. One afternoon thunderstorm that moved into Kern County between Boron and Edwards AFB had gusts to 45 mph.  Other thunderstorms just east of Kern County, or over western San Bernardino County, produced gusts to 45 mph as they collapsed during the evening hours. These gusts also moved into southeastern Kern County. A spotter in Rosamond reported a wind-driven dust cloud that moved through Rosamond.  The 9th also saw the Excessive Heat Watch upgraded to a Warning as computer model runs continued to forecast near-record heat for August 10th-12th. With well above-normal temperatures and abundant monsoonal moisture, convection again fired up over the mountains and desert on the 10th. During this day, lightning sparked another large wildfire in the Kern County mountains, called the Jawbone Complex (about 15 miles northeast of Tehachapi).  As expected, temperature records began falling as the strong upper-level ridge remained in place over the southwestern United States. The Kern County desert initially recorded the warmest temperatures; however, enough monsoonal moisture returned to allow blow-off from the isolated thunderstorms to form a cloud layer over these areas by the 11th so that temperatures moderated. In contrast, temperatures continued to warm over the San Joaquin Valley, where Fresno and Bakersfield reached 110 degrees on the 13th.  On August 12th, a thunderstorm developed near Mojave that produced a 57 mph wind gust, prompting a severe thunderstorm warning to be issued. Thunderstorms lasted through the afternoon and early evening hours during this day throughout the desert areas in Kern County.  By August 13th, an upper-level low was located off the Pacific coast of Baja California. The combination of the ridge over the Southwest and the low off the coast kept a southeasterly flow over California that continued to bring monsoonal moisture into the state from the south. This moisture produced mid-level clouds that persisted over parts of the San Joaquin Valley, even during the night-time hours and kept overnight lows at record or near-record high values.  Thunderstorms developed again by midday on August 13th, with lightning strikes occurring from the eastern Tehachapi Mountains north to Yosemite National Park. Some of these strikes triggered wildfires in the Southern Sierra Nevada and near Tehachapi, including the multi-fire Tehachapi Complex, and outflow winds gusted to around 50 mph in Ridgecrest. At the lower elevations, well-above-normal temperatures continued, prompting a one day extension of the Excessive Heat Warning.  August 14th saw more thunderstorms over the mountains and desert as monsoonal moisture continued to stream into the hot airmass over the central California interior. One thunderstorm over southeastern Kern County reached severe levels, as outflow winds reached 67 mph at Edwards Air Force Base.  Also, clouds from this monsoonal moisture kept overnight lows at record warm levels. Both Bakersfield and Fresno set high minimum temperature records. Bakersfield never got below 83 degrees, and Fresno was only a degree cooler.  Local media reported a window washer in Bakersfield was hospitalized and suffered heat illness during the August 14th heat wave.",35.07,-118.15
394426,7/20/2012 22:10,50,MG,Measured at the Lake Pend Oreille Buoy.,"One of the largest and most widespread severe weather events occurred across the Spokane County Warning Area on July 20th.  Several days prior to the day of the event, a deep upper-level low slowly sagged down the Pacific Northwest Coastline.  Southerly flow ahead of the low pumped moist, unstable air into the Inland Northwest.  The combination of afternoon heating and smaller impulses ejecting from the offshore low kept the region very unsettled with several rounds of severe thunderstorms from the 15th through the 19th.  On the morning of the 20th, the remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio became ingested into the southerly flow and transported toward the region.  Meanwhile, a shortwave dropping into the Gulf of Alaska acted to kick the upper-low off the southwestern Oregon Coast inland.  The upper-level wave took on a strong negative tilt, driven northeastward by a 75kt jet streak, crossing through Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho during the early to late afternoon on July 20th.  The combination of strong dynamic forcing along the shortwave, presence of an abnormally moist, unstable air mass, highly diffluent flow aloft, and jet streak dynamics led to numerous severe thunderstorms across Northern Idaho.  Severe hail and winds were observed with storms during the early afternoon across lower portions of the Idaho Panhandle.  The threat transitioned to severe winds by the mid to late afternoon as storms migrated into northern sections of the Panhandle with hundreds of downed trees and one fatality.",48.02,-116.5

394662,7/20/2012 19:55,57,MG,Measured at the Vantage Washington DOT sensor.,"One of the most widespread severe weather events occurred across the Spokane County Warning Area on July 20th.  Several days prior to the day of the event, a deep upper-level low slowly sagged down the Pacific Northwest Coastline.  Southerly flow ahead of the low pumped moist, unstable air into the Inland Northwest.  The combination of afternoon heating and smaller impulses ejecting from the offshore low kept the region very unsettled with several rounds of severe thunderstorms from the 15th through the 19th.  On the morning of the 20th, the remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio became ingested into the southerly flow and transported toward the region.  Meanwhile, a shortwave dropping into the Gulf of Alaska acted to kick the upper-low off the southwestern Oregon Coast inland.  The upper-level wave took on a strong negative tilt, driven northeastward by a 75kt jet streak, crossing through Eastern Washington during the early to late afternoon on July 20th.  The combination of strong dynamic forcing along the shortwave, presence of an abnormally moist, unstable air mass, time of day, highly diffluent flow aloft, and jet streak dynamics led to numerous severe thunderstorms across Eastern Washington.  Severe hail, winds, and flash flooding were observed with storms during the early afternoon but the threat transitioned to severe winds by the mid to late afternoon as storms migrated into the Northeastern Mountains.  These storms blew down hundreds of trees causing one fatality.  Ferry and Okanogan Counties were the hardest hit counties and experienced power outages in some remote communities in excess of one week.  Consequently, state and federal assistance was necessary.  Preliminary damage figures for Ferry County estimated 2.6 million in debris removal, 1.6 million in emergency protective measures, 128 thousand for road and bridge repair, 570 thousand to building and equipment, 3.2 million for utility repair, and 163 thousand for parks and recreation.  7000 people lost power in Ferry County and three major roads were closed for sometime due to downed trees.  These roads included Highway 21, 97, and 155.  Utility companies estimated 200 downed power poles and 40 miles of line needed restoration.  In Okanogan County, estimations of 82 thousand in debris removal, 36 thousand in emergency protective measures, 180 thousand for road and bridge repair, 419 thousand to building and equipment, 364 thousand for utility repair, and 25 thousand for parks and recreation.  Cumulative figures indicated a total of 8.4 million for Ferry and 1.1 million for Okanogan.  Due to the complexity and magnitude of this event, Appendix B was utilized to estimate individual costs for each event.  Cumulative figures listed in the Episode narrative would be more representative of the actual event.  Some reports stated that private weather instruments at residents houses recorded winds between 80 and 100 mph.",46.96,-119.95
