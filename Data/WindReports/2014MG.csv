Within this hardest-hit zone, a few of the highest snow totals from NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers featured 7.5 three miles west of Elba, 7.0 seven miles south of Litchfield and also four miles east-southeast of Sumner, 6.7 at Wolbach and 6.1 at St. Paul. Outside this primary snow band, including most locations south and southeast of a line from Franklin-Grand Island-York, accumulations averaged no more than 1-2. However, even these areas endured at least a brief bout of very poor visibilities in wind-blown snow. As for the timing of snow, it was a typical west-to-east transition from rain to snow with a brief period of sleet in between. The aforementioned, significant snow band that targeted western and northern counties produced most of its impacts between 11 AM-3 PM CDT, remaining quasi-stationary for several hours within a focused mid-level deformation zone. During the later afternoon and early evening hours, the band became much more progressive as it marched eastward through the remainder of South Central Nebraska, eventually exiting the eastern fringes of the local area between 8-10 PM CDT.   Before the wintry aspect of this system took center stage, convection was the initial focus of the day as primarily the southeast half of the 24-county area saw fairly widespread coverage of thunderstorms for the first time in 2014. Strong storms began flaring up mainly south of Interstate 80 between 6-8 AM CDT, with one storm producing hail up to quarter size in far eastern Fillmore County. Although no additional storms met severe-criteria, several produced copious amounts of small hail, resulting in a report of slick roadways in parts of Franklin County. Although the existing gradient wind across the area was already quite strong, the presence of thunderstorm outflow likely further-enhanced gusts, resulting in peak speeds to around 60 MPH as measured at the Kearney airport. Thunderstorm-enhanced winds likely also contributed to the destruction of a building under construction in eastern Franklin County. As increasingly-colder air surged across the area from west-to-east during the late morning and early afternoon hours, thunderstorms all but ended within the area by 2 PM CDT.   As earlier mentioned, this snow event ended up being much more impactful than anticipated, in part because most computer forecast models failed to predict the intense banding and also underestimated the speed and magnitude of cold air surging into the area. Furthermore, the heavy snowfall rates overwhelmed any melting influences from antecedent warm ground conditions. As testament to the stark weather changes associated with this system, afternoon high temperatures on the preceding afternoon of the 12th ranged from 76-80 F across most of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 13th, the powerful cold front had pushed well south of the area along an axis from southwest Kansas to southern Iowa, with temperatures across most of the local area already well down into the 40s F. By early afternoon when snow was well-underway, temperatures across the majority of South Central Nebraska had plunged to 30-35 F, promoting wind chill values generally 15-20 F. In the mid-upper levels, a longwave trough dominated much of the central United States and Nebraska resided under a favorable coupled upper jet regime within the exit region of a southern stream branch sliding across the Southern Plains and the entrance region of a northern stream jet centered from the eastern Dakotas into Canada. A bit lower in the troposphere, a pronounced zone of frontogenesis/deformation focused across the heart of South Central Nebraska along the path of a 700 millibar low pressure center and to the northwest of a closed 850 millibar low that tracked from southwest Kansas to southern Iowa. On a positive note, the combination of rain and snow brought much-needed liquid precipitation totals of 0.40-0.80 to the majority of the area, with amounts in excess of 1 common in the corridor of heaviest snow, highlighted by 1.98 at Holdrege. As is typical of April snow, it did not stick around long as high temperatures two days later bounced back into the 60s.",40.73,-99

In fact, the only severe-criteria report from the local area was a 58 MPH wind gust at the Phillipsburg airport at 814 pm CDT as strong outflow winds surged into the area along a line of thunderstorms marching in from the west. On a positive note, much of North Central Kansas received much-needed modest rainfall totals between 0.50-1.00 from this event, with higher totals of generally 1.50-2.50 centered over Phillips County including 2.48 reported by the NWS cooperative observer in Phillipsburg.   As for event-timing, a smattering of isolated convection initially flared up within the local area between 330-500 pm CDT. However, for the next few hours North Central Kansas remained storm-free as the vast majority of convection focused off to the north and west within a narrow corridor along an invading cold front. Eventually, several rounds of mainly sub-severe multicell storms pushed into the Phillips, Rooks and Smith counties between 7-11 pm CDT, with much of this activity linear in nature. As this activity steadily weakened toward the midnight hour due to the onset of diurnal cooling and the increasingly outflow-dominant mode, it also expanded in coverage across the remainder of the local area, with light to moderate rain lingering well into the early morning hours of the 24th. In the mid-upper levels, the primary forcing for this event was provided by low-amplitude shortwave troughs kicking out across the Central Plains in southwesterly flow, downstream from a large-scale trough axis slowly sliding east through the Rockies. At the surface, the aforementioned, well-defined cold front was the primary low-level trigger, as this front stretched from northeast Nebraska through northwest Kansas during the late afternoon where it connected to a strong 993 millibar low centered in far eastern Colorado. Although low-level moisture was seasonably sparse with surface dewpoints only averaging in the upper 40s-low 50s F, steep low-mid level lapse rates promoted modest mixed-layer CAPE of 500-1000 J/kg in the presence of respectable 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear of 40-50 knots.",39.73,-99.32

525119,6/15/2014 5:06,50,MG,nan,"During a month that had several rounds of severe weather in South Central Nebraska, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east through most locations near and south of Interstate 80 during the later evening. Earlier in the event, more discrete convection resulted primarily in numerous reports of severe-criteria hail, some as large as tennis ball to grapefruit size, along with four confirmed, brief EF0 tornadoes that yielded no reports of damage. The first of these tornadoes occurred in northwestern Franklin County near Hildreth around 730 pm CDT. The other three tornadoes were associated with a supercell storm that drifted northeast out of Kansas along a path from Webster to Hamilton counties before being absorbed into a larger line of convection. The first of these tornadoes was sighted in far southwestern Webster County around 830 pm CDT while the final two brief touchdowns occurred after nightfall in southwestern Hamilton County between Trumbull and Giltner between 1000-1030 pm CDT. In terms of hail, the largest confirmed stone of 4.25 fell three miles southeast of Hastings around 930 pm CDT. Other notable hail reports included stones up to baseball size along the Nance-Merrick County line, in and near Gibbon, near Ayr and in Arapahoe. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across roughly the southern half of the 24-county area later in the evening ended up being the big story of this event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through essentially all areas between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 82 MPH by a storm chaser near the Interstate 80 York exit, 79 MPH at Hastings airport, and 76 MPH at home weather stations near Davenport and Ohiowa. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and also damaged several structures, including outbuildings, grain bins and power poles. To cite just a few examples of this damage as it progressed from west to east: at Harlan County Lake at least four small boats were rammed into the shore and a camping trailer was overturned onto a vehicle, in Guide Rock a garage was blown off its foundation and partially onto a roadway, and at the Nuckolls County fairgrounds in Nelson a tin roof was removed from a barn, the roof of the arena was damaged and a camper was flipped on its side. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most storms, rainfall totals across much of South Central Nebraska did not exceed 1-2 inches. However, a southwest-to-northeast corridor of 2-3 and locally higher rainfall centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Wilcox-Grand Island-Genoa, featuring NeRAIN observer totals of 4.13 three miles west-southwest of Genoa and 4.06 two miles of Doniphan.  Breaking down event timing, the initial round of at least semi-discrete convection, including a few supercells, flared up between 530-730 pm CDT within a fairly narrow southwest-to-northeast oriented corridor along a slow-moving but well-defined cold front. Most of this early convection concentrated several miles either side of a line from near Franklin and Red Cloud in the south, then north-northeast through the Hastings-Grand Island-Central City-Fullerton areas. Generally between 730-930 pm CDT, this initially narrow corridor of storms gradually expanded in coverage to both the west and east. Then, even as ongoing convection remained strong to severe, the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of southwest Nebraska, entering southwestern portions of the local area between 930-1030 pm CDT. For the next few hours generally between 1030 pm to 1 am CDT, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of roughly the southern half of South Central Nebraska, while the far northern end of the line gradually merged with the earlier convection that had largely lifted north of Interstate 80 by this time and had weakened somewhat. Finally, between 1-2 am CDT, the line of severe storms cleared the far eastern edges of the local area near the Highway 81 corridor, leaving behind only a trailing zone of stratiform rain that lingered into the pre-dawn hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska by early evening. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the upper-80s to lower-90s F while dewpoints generally held in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/expanded the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.8055,-98.6

Strengthening mid level winds along with a strong low level jet in place later in the evening and overnight on June 17 produced widespread damaging winds of 60 to 70 mph.

530469,6/21/2014 3:11,50,MG,A thunderstorm wind gust was measured at 58 mph.,"Although ground-truth reports of severe-criteria hail and wind emanated from only seven counties mainly within northern and central portions of South Central Nebraska on this Friday, the coverage of non-severe thunderstorms and locally heavy rain became rather widespread across much of the area during the late evening and lasting into the early morning hours of the 21st. Despite the somewhat limited areal coverage of verified severe storms, this was a more-significant-than-expected and fairly long-lasting event, as 25 severe thunderstorm warnings were issued in the local area over the course of eight hours between 230-1030 pm CDT, including for a storm that pounded parts of Grand Island with hail up to baseball size.    Several hours prior to the primary severe weather event, a lone morning storm dropped nickel size hail as it passed through Valley and Greeley counties. During the early stages of the main afternoon/evening development, generally between 230-500 pm CDT, transient clusters of strong to marginally severe multicell storms affected areas north of Highway 92, producing ping pong ball size hail near Cotesfield. The next few hours featured the storms of the day as a pair of very slow-moving supercells pounded the northern Hall and southern Howard county area. For the city of Grand Island, the first of these storms likely resulted in the most significant severe event of the 2014 convective season, as a swath extending from a few miles northwest of the city to near the downtown area was drilled with hail stones ranging from quarter to baseball size between mainly 6-7 pm CDT. During this same time frame, a separate, smaller severe storm in Sherman County dropped very large hail up to 3 in diameter in the Rockville area. As the initial Grand Island supercell started dissipating, a second supercell flared up just to its west over northwestern Hall County mainly between 730-830 pm CDT, pounding the Cairo area with hail up to golf ball size for several minutes. While this second supercell started to weaken, a considerable flare-up of strong to severe multicell convection commenced between 730-900 pm CDT within several northern and western counties such as Sherman, Dawson, Gosper and Furnas, resulting in a few reports of estimated 60-65 MPH winds. Generally between 9-11 pm CDT, much of this widespread convection rapidly congealed into a southeast-surging quasi-linear complex that took aim on the Tri-Cities area. During this time, measured wind gusts in Hall County included 58 MPH at the Grand Island airport and 76 MPH at a home weather station near Wood River. These damaging gusts then barreled into Adams County where Hastings airport measured a 67 MPH gust, resulting in the second round of tree damage and fairly minor structural damage within the city in less than one weeks time. Beyond 11 pm CDT, there were no further reports of severe storms within South Central Nebraska, although widespread redevelopment of convection continued through the night, especially near the Interstate 80 and Highway 6 corridors. By the end of the night, most of the 24-county area had tallied anywhere from 0.50 to 2 of rain. However, much higher pockets of at least 3-4 of rain targeted primarily northern Hall and southern Howard counties, northern Adams County and central/western Clay County. A few of the highest storm totals from a combination of automated gauges, NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers included 4.07 five miles west-southwest of Clay Center, 3.31 at Hastings airport and 3.11 three miles east-southeast of Dannebrog. Not surprisingly, short-term flooding issues materialized. While rain was still falling during the evening, water was reported over several county roads in southwestern Howard County, along with Highway 11 near Dannebrog. After daybreak on the 21st, reports arrived of several county roads in northwestern Adams County covered in water.     In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this was not really a synoptically-evident severe weather setup, thanks largely to the lack of a notable mid-upper level disturbance and also seasonably-weak deep layer wind shear. As a result, the severity/longevity of this event was largely underestimated in official forecasts, even within 12 hours of its onset. In the mid levels, fairly weak quasi-zonal flow containing very subtle disturbances was in place over Nebraska, well to the south of a compact-but-strong closed low churning over Saskatchewan and Manitoba. At the surface, only a few subtle boundaries were present within the region, but no well-defined fronts. However, as afternoon temperatures rose well into the upper 80s-low 90s F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s, significant instability developed in the form of mixed-layer CAPE soaring to between 3000-4000 J/kg. Despite 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear averaging no more than 20-30 knots, this highly unstable environment supported robust convection, including the few slow-moving supercells. After dark, the briefly-severe squall line and subsequent multi-hour period of regenerative non-severe storms was aided by the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet centered over western KS.",40.97,-98.32

These storms were primarily damaging wind-producers. However, the one known severe-criteria hail report was a significant one as golf ball to softball size stones occurred near Agra. Wind-wise, the initial storm complex that moved into the area from northwest Kansas yielded severe-criteria measured gusts at Logan (58 MPH) and Phillipsburg airport (67 MPH). A bit later in the evening, following the merger of the first storm complex with a stronger, larger MCS diving southeastward out of south central Nebraska, Jewell and Mitchell counties bore the brunt of damaging winds including estimated 70 MPH winds in Mankato, a measured 86 MPH gust near Jewell, and a report of tree branches downed throughout Beloit. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection held amounts under 1 inch in most places.    Timing-wise, the first storm complex tracked into Phillips and Rooks counties from the west between 7-8 pm CDT, having grown upscale from its humble late-afternoon beginnings along western portions of the Kansas-Nebraska border. As this initial area of convection reached far eastern portions of Smith and Osborne counties around 930 pm CDT, its northern end quickly merged with the leading edges of a stronger linear MCS charging southeastward out of Nebraska. During the ensuing hour, strong to severe winds swept through Jewell and Mitchell counties before departing the local area to the east and southeast. Although showers/weak storms lingered over some places a bit longer, the vast majority of the local area was void of precipitation by 1230 am CDT on the 18th.   By late-summer standards, this synoptic and mesoscale setup was fairly ripe for an organized severe weather event. In the mid-upper levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough brushed into the Central Plains from the northwest, along the southern periphery of a larger scale disturbance centered over southern Saskatchewan/Manitoba. As a result, mid-upper level flow increased enough to promote generally 30-35 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear over North Central Kansas. In addition, instability was quite potent as the combination of afternoon surface temperatures in the 90s F and dewpoints in the 60s promoted mixed-layer CAPE values of 2000-4000 J/kg ahead of the incoming convective complexes.",39.67,-99.57
539542,8/18/2014 0:41,50,MG,Spotter measured the wind gust with a hand held anemometer.,"During a four-hour period centered from 630-1030 pm CDT on this Sunday evening, a complex of severe thunderstorms tracked from northwest-to-southeast through primarily the southwestern two-thirds of South Central Nebraska, resulting in numerous reports of damaging winds ranging from 60 to around 80 MPH. Hail was not a significant issue, with nickel size stones being the largest reported. Although high winds also affected some counties farther west, the primary swath of damaging winds was roughly 20-40 miles wide, extending from the Valley/Sherman counties area in the northwest, southeastward through the Hall/Adams/Nuckolls counties areas. Along this main corridor, a sampling of the most wind significant reports in chronological order included: estimated 70 MPH winds in the Elyria and Litchfield areas with crop and tree damage, a measured 71 MPH gust near Wood River, a measured peak gust of 83 MPH at Hastings airport along with 10-20 minutes of persistent 60-80 MPH wind behind the initial surge, and up to 30 minutes of estimated 60-70 MPH gusts in Superior. Off to the west of this main zone of wind issues, there were a few reports of gusts around 60 MPH in the Lexington and Arapahoe areas. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection kept totals in most places no higher than 0.50-1.50 inches, with a few of the wetter exceptions per NeRAIN observes featuring 2.30 nine miles northwest of Ord and 2.13 six miles southeast of Davenport.   In a basic sense, this event consisted of an initially semi-discrete supercell cluster that first developed in north central Nebraska during the mid-afternoon hours and then gradually grew upscale into a larger-scale, forward-propagating linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) as it crossed the local South Central Nebraska area. This intense storm complex first infiltrated the local area into Valley/Sherman/Dawson counties between 630-730 pm CDT, blew through the Grand Island/Hastings areas during the 815-930 pm CDT time frame and finally departed southeastward into northern Kansas between 10-11 pm CDT. Although showers/weak storms lingered over mainly eastern counties a bit longer, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska was void of precipitation by 1 am CDT on the 18th.   By late-summer standards, this synoptic and mesoscale setup was fairly ripe for an organized severe weather event. In the mid-upper levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough brushed into Nebraska from the northwest, along the southern periphery of a larger scale disturbance centered over southern Saskatchewan/Manitoba.

Just before 5 p.m. CDT, an isolated supercell formed over Phillips County, Kansas. This storm split and the left-mover advanced northwestward into Harlan and Furnas counties. This storm briefly produced hail up to the size of nickels near Oxford, then rapidly dissipated thereafter. Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms over central Kansas formed a line along a common cold pool. A squall line formed and advanced north-northeastward across South Central Nebraska between 8 p.m. and midnight CDT. This line produced multiple wind gusts above 50 MPH, including one measured gust of 58 MPH at a mesonet site in the town of Pleasanton.  A quasi-stationary front extended from southwest-northeast across Kansas and Nebraska, serving as the focus for the thunderstorm development. The upper level flow was characterized by a broad anticyclonic circulation over the Mississippi Valley with a trough over the western states. Prior to the storms moving in, temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s with dewpoints in the lower to middle 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but the high dewpoints resulted in MLCAPE around 3,000 J/kg. The polar jet stream was just west of the region and arced anticyclonically through the Northern Plains. Deep layer shear was just under 30 knots which was favorable for primarily multicell storm structures.

Ahead of the storm system low pressure developed over the high Plains and allowed for warm and moist air to pool over the mid Missouri River Valley creating strong instability by mid to late afternoon. As a cold front and associated upper level jet streak interacted with the instability, thunderstorms developed from northeast Nebraska into Northern Kansas. These thunderstorms moved east through the rest of the afternoon and evening hours, crossing eastern Nebraska and western Iowa produced mainly hail and wind damage, but heavy rainfall also occurred in parts of the area as well.",41.46,-96.08
531705,9/1/2014 1:12,50,MG,nan,"An unstable airmass was in place across Iowa with afternoon highs reaching well into the 80s, and dewpoint readings in the low to mid 70s. CAPE rose to 2000 to 3000 J/kg. Downdraft CAPE was around 900 to 1000 J/kg, with CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere in the 600 to 900 J/kg range. Precipitable water increased to around 1.75 inches. The freezing level was quite high at around 15,000 feet. Fairly strong shear was present with 40 to 50 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  These parameters led to an unusual event across Iowa with numerous relatively short track tornadoes along with several reports of straight line wind damage.    The event started when a line of thunderstorms formed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa then moved east across the state through the evening hours. Hail with the storms was generally quite small. One inch diameter hail fell in Crawford County in Dow City.  However, high winds were much more common as the MCS progressed across the state. Several locations reported gusts of 60 MPH or higher. An 80 MPH gust was reported in Guthrie County at Yale and Bayard. A 71 MPH wind gust occurred in Marion County. Heavy rainfall was also of significance with flash flooding in Crawford County. This was caused by a dam failure which flooded Highway 39. Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes in Dallas County. There were numerous reports of around 2 inches of rain falling in Boone and Polk Counties. Water ponding and low-land flooding was common. One person was struck by lightning at the Denison Airport. The person received minor injuries. Additional heavy rainfall events are included on 01 September 2014 entry.  The most impressive aspect of this episode was the unusual number of tornadoes documented via high resolution aerial imagery.  A total of 35 tornadoes were found across all of Iowa including 32 in the Des Moines forecast area and another 3 in the La Crosse forecast area in northeast Iowa.  While many of these tornadoes remained in rural areas producing only crop damage, 15 of them produced some sort of property damage on farmsteads or confinement operations.  Only two of the tornadoes were reported during or shortly after the event with the remainder found nearly a year later via high resolution aerial imagery.

531706,9/1/2014 1:40,50,MG,nan,"An unstable airmass was in place across Iowa with afternoon highs reaching well into the 80s, and dewpoint readings in the low to mid 70s. CAPE rose to 2000 to 3000 J/kg. Downdraft CAPE was around 900 to 1000 J/kg, with CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere in the 600 to 900 J/kg range. Precipitable water increased to around 1.75 inches. The freezing level was quite high at around 15,000 feet. Fairly strong shear was present with 40 to 50 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  These parameters led to an unusual event across Iowa with numerous relatively short track tornadoes along with several reports of straight line wind damage.    The event started when a line of thunderstorms formed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa then moved east across the state through the evening hours. Hail with the storms was generally quite small. One inch diameter hail fell in Crawford County in Dow City.  However, high winds were much more common as the MCS progressed across the state. Several locations reported gusts of 60 MPH or higher. An 80 MPH gust was reported in Guthrie County at Yale and Bayard. A 71 MPH wind gust occurred in Marion County. Heavy rainfall was also of significance with flash flooding in Crawford County. This was caused by a dam failure which flooded Highway 39. Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes in Dallas County. There were numerous reports of around 2 inches of rain falling in Boone and Polk Counties. Water ponding and low-land flooding was common. One person was struck by lightning at the Denison Airport. The person received minor injuries. Additional heavy rainfall events are included on 01 September 2014 entry.  The most impressive aspect of this episode was the unusual number of tornadoes documented via high resolution aerial imagery.  A total of 35 tornadoes were found across all of Iowa including 32 in the Des Moines forecast area and another 3 in the La Crosse forecast area in northeast Iowa.  While many of these tornadoes remained in rural areas producing only crop damage, 15 of them produced some sort of property damage on farmsteads or confinement operations.  Only two of the tornadoes were reported during or shortly after the event with the remainder found nearly a year later via high resolution aerial imagery.

515981,6/1/2014 22:20,51,MG,nan,"Following a three-week minimum in severe thunderstorm activity within this six-county North Central Kansas area, the month of June kicked off with a relatively widespread severe episode centered during the late afternoon hours on this Sunday. In general, this event consisted of several small clusters of multicell storms gradually morphing into a more organized, east-southeast surging squall line. Ground-truth storm reports consisted of a fairly even mix of hail and winds. Hail-wise, stones up to golf ball size were reported in Alton and up to ping pong ball size in Osborne. All known severe-criteria wind reports emanated from Osborne and Jewell counties, including estimated gusts of 70 MPH in Formoso which caused tree damage. On a positive note, this event brought a much-needed soaking rain of generally 1-3 to the majority of the local area. Localized spots slightly exceeded 3, including CoCoRaHS and NWS cooperative observer 24-hour totals featuring 3.40 two miles southwest of Alton and 3.23 at both Ionia and seven miles northwest of Lebanon.   Rather weak, non-severe elevated thunderstorms got underway across parts of the area fairly early in the day between 10 am-1 pm CDT. During the 1-4 pm CDT time frame, transient clusters of storms gradually intensified and became strong to marginally severe as they tracked northeastward over the area. The ensuing three hours between 4-7 pm CDT then featured the main event of the day as ongoing storm clusters over North Central Kansas gradually grew upscale into a linear complex that also merged with a small line segment dropping southeast out of southern Nebraska. By the time this maturing squall line reached the Jewell, Mitchell and southeastern Osborne counties area, the large hail threat declined as strong winds took center stage. By 830 pm CDT, nearly all convection had vacated the local area into central and northeastern Kansas. In the big picture aloft, this event was driven by a series of low amplitude shortwave disturbances ejecting eastward out of the Central Rockies into the Central Plains, along the southeastern periphery of a parent trough shifting eastward from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, convection intensified ahead of and along the combination of a convectively-driven outflow boundary and synoptic-scale cold front gradually working southeastward across the region. Although early-day convection and resultant cloud cover kept much of North Central Kansas from realizing its full potential for low level destabilization, parts of the area were able to at least briefly realize high temperatures in the 80s F, along with dewpoints in the low-mid 60s. As storms intensified during the afternoon hours, the mesoscale environment featured steep mid level lapse rates, mixed layer CAPE up to around 2000 J/kg and increasing 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of at least 30-40 knots.",39.44,-98.7

525139,6/15/2014 4:48,51,MG,nan,"During a month with several rounds of severe weather in this six-county portion of North Central Kansas, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east across the area in the form of an intense forward-propagating squall line. A few hours prior to these severe winds entering the local area, an isolated supercell storm cluster drifted slowly northeast across parts of Rooks, Phillips and Smith counties before departing into Nebraska, producing one highly-visible, short-track landspout tornado and a few reports of quarter to golf ball size hail. The EF1-rated tornado, which touched down around 530 pm CDT near Webster State Park shortly after storms first initiated, damaged power poles and fencing along its brief path. In terms of hail, the largest reported golf ball size stones fell in the Glade area shortly after the dissipation of the Rooks County tornado. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across the six-county area later in the evening was truly the main event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through nearly every square mile of North Central Kansas. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 86 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport and 77 MPH at a home weather station near Webber. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and likely also damaged several structures. Based on a limited number of damage reports that were received, one of the more newsworthy incidents involved several campers blown over at Webster State Park, along with a roof blown off a cabin. Due to the progressive nature of these storms, rainfall totals across most of North Central Kansas averaged less than 1.   Breaking down event timing, the initial supercell cluster that produced the landspout tornado in northern Rooks County flared up between 5-6 pm CDT near the leading edge of the invading cold front. As this storm cluster slowly drifted northeast through Smith County, it evolved into a more compact-but-organized discrete supercell that exited northward into Nebraska around 830 pm CDT. This storms departure ushered in a nearly two-hour lull in local thunderstorm activity, before the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of northwest Kansas into Phillips and Rooks counties between 10-11 pm CDT. For the next few hours, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of the six-county area before gradually departing the eastern edges of Jewell and Mitchell counties between 12-1 am CDT, leaving behind only a trailing area of stratiform rain that lingered for a few more hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged southeastward into North Central Kansas during the evening, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the low-mid 90s F while dewpoints generally averaged in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed much of North Central Kansas in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",39.47,-98.13

Although radar data suggested that this storm may have produced hail up to quarter size, all ground-truth storm reports involved severe winds in Phillips County. These reports included a measured 59 MPH gust in Logan and estimated 65-70 MPH winds in a few locations between Phillipsburg and Long Island. Emergency management reported power poles downed approximately six miles northwest of Phillipsburg.   This storm initially became severe between 800-830 pm CDT just west of the local area in Graham/Norton counties, evolving from various small clusters of strong to severe multicell convection that had been percolating in northwest Kansas since mid-afternoon. The environment was primed for severe wind gusts, given steep low level lapse rates and 25-30 F temperature-dewpoint depressions featuring temps around 90 and dewpoints in the low-mid 60s. After crossing through Phillips County and clipping extreme northwestern Smith County, this storm departed into Nebraska. Although a few non-severe storms brushed into North Central Kansas during the ensuing overnight hours, none of them were very strong, let alone severe. In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, evening convection was forced by a low amplitude disturbance ejecting northeastward across the Central Plains in south-southwesterly flow, well to the southeast of a parent closed mid level low anchored over the Montana-Alberta-Saskatchewan border area. At the surface, this storm developed in the vicinity of a quasi-stationary front aligned from west central Kansas to north central Nebraska.

However, all severe-criteria hail and wind reports, along with the heaviest pockets of torrential rainfall, targeted Jewell County along with northern and eastern portions of Smith and Mitchell counties. All severe reports in these areas occurred between 8-10 pm CDT in association with a southeastward-drifting supercell cluster that first blossomed over Franklin County Nebraska before crossing the state line into the local area. As this initially rather discrete severe storm affected Smith County mainly between 8-9 pm CDT, it resulted in several reports of quarter to golf ball size hail in the Bellaire and Lebanon areas, and even one baseball size report just south of Lebanon. In that same portion of Smith County, estimated wind gusts up to around 80 MPH downed several power poles. Even slightly outside the main path of this storm, severe outflow winds of 59 MPH were measured at Smith Center airport. As the initial supercell merged into newly-developing convection over Jewell and northern Mitchell counties to become a larger-scale cluster, additional severe reports included estimated 60 MPH winds at Burr Oak and half dollar size hail several miles east of Beloit. At the same time severe weather was ongoing in Jewell and Mitchell counties, additional strong storms flared up farther west across parts of Phillips, Rooks, Smith and Osborne counties between 9-10 pm CDT. After 11 pm CDT storms across the local area weakened considerably, and by 2 am CDT the entire area was essentially rain-free.   Rainfall-wise, the primary severe storm cluster produced three distinct, albeit small bullseyes of very heavy rainfall of generally 3-5. One of these was in northeastern Smith County, another in south central Jewell County where the NWS cooperative observer at Ionia measured 4.36, and the third one in northeastern Mitchell County where a CoCoRaHS observer reported 5.00 approximately five miles east of Beloit. Despite these pockets of very heavy rain there were very few ground-truth reports of flooding, although the Solomon River near Simpson crested only a few inches below flood stage on Sunday the 10th.   This was a fairly typical late-summer severe weather event featuring fairly high instability values but only modest deep layer wind shear and weak large scale forcing. In the mid to upper levels, generally quasi-zonal flow was in place over the Central Plains, containing one or more fairly subtle shortwave troughs. At the surface, storms initiated in the vicinity of a northwest-southeast oriented quasi stationary front draped through the local area along an axis from western Nebraska to southeast Kansas, with this front partially comprised of a remnant outflow boundary from storms the night before. With surface dewpoints well into the 60s F across the local area, most-unstable CAPE climbed as high as 2000-3000 J/kg. Although at least one storm in the local area briefly exhibited supercell structure, 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear only averaging around 30 knots promoted a predominant multicell/quasi-linear mode.",39.75,-98.78

Precipitable water increased to around 1.75 inches. The freezing level was quite high at around 15,000 feet. Fairly strong shear was present with 40 to 50 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  These parameters led to an unusual event across Iowa with numerous relatively short track tornadoes along with several reports of straight line wind damage.    The event started when a line of thunderstorms formed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa then moved east across the state through the evening hours. Hail with the storms was generally quite small. One inch diameter hail fell in Crawford County in Dow City.  However, high winds were much more common as the MCS progressed across the state. Several locations reported gusts of 60 MPH or higher. An 80 MPH gust was reported in Guthrie County at Yale and Bayard. A 71 MPH wind gust occurred in Marion County. Heavy rainfall was also of significance with flash flooding in Crawford County. This was caused by a dam failure which flooded Highway 39. Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes in Dallas County. There were numerous reports of around 2 inches of rain falling in Boone and Polk Counties. Water ponding and low-land flooding was common. One person was struck by lightning at the Denison Airport.

524762,6/15/2014 3:55,52,MG,nan,"During a month that had several rounds of severe weather in South Central Nebraska, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east through most locations near and south of Interstate 80 during the later evening. Earlier in the event, more discrete convection resulted primarily in numerous reports of severe-criteria hail, some as large as tennis ball to grapefruit size, along with four confirmed, brief EF0 tornadoes that yielded no reports of damage. The first of these tornadoes occurred in northwestern Franklin County near Hildreth around 730 pm CDT. The other three tornadoes were associated with a supercell storm that drifted northeast out of Kansas along a path from Webster to Hamilton counties before being absorbed into a larger line of convection. The first of these tornadoes was sighted in far southwestern Webster County around 830 pm CDT while the final two brief touchdowns occurred after nightfall in southwestern Hamilton County between Trumbull and Giltner between 1000-1030 pm CDT. In terms of hail, the largest confirmed stone of 4.25 fell three miles southeast of Hastings around 930 pm CDT. Other notable hail reports included stones up to baseball size along the Nance-Merrick County line, in and near Gibbon, near Ayr and in Arapahoe. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across roughly the southern half of the 24-county area later in the evening ended up being the big story of this event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through essentially all areas between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 82 MPH by a storm chaser near the Interstate 80 York exit, 79 MPH at Hastings airport, and 76 MPH at home weather stations near Davenport and Ohiowa. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and also damaged several structures, including outbuildings, grain bins and power poles. To cite just a few examples of this damage as it progressed from west to east: at Harlan County Lake at least four small boats were rammed into the shore and a camping trailer was overturned onto a vehicle, in Guide Rock a garage was blown off its foundation and partially onto a roadway, and at the Nuckolls County fairgrounds in Nelson a tin roof was removed from a barn, the roof of the arena was damaged and a camper was flipped on its side. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most storms, rainfall totals across much of South Central Nebraska did not exceed 1-2 inches. However, a southwest-to-northeast corridor of 2-3 and locally higher rainfall centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Wilcox-Grand Island-Genoa, featuring NeRAIN observer totals of 4.13 three miles west-southwest of Genoa and 4.06 two miles of Doniphan.  Breaking down event timing, the initial round of at least semi-discrete convection, including a few supercells, flared up between 530-730 pm CDT within a fairly narrow southwest-to-northeast oriented corridor along a slow-moving but well-defined cold front. Most of this early convection concentrated several miles either side of a line from near Franklin and Red Cloud in the south, then north-northeast through the Hastings-Grand Island-Central City-Fullerton areas. Generally between 730-930 pm CDT, this initially narrow corridor of storms gradually expanded in coverage to both the west and east. Then, even as ongoing convection remained strong to severe, the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of southwest Nebraska, entering southwestern portions of the local area between 930-1030 pm CDT. For the next few hours generally between 1030 pm to 1 am CDT, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of roughly the southern half of South Central Nebraska, while the far northern end of the line gradually merged with the earlier convection that had largely lifted north of Interstate 80 by this time and had weakened somewhat. Finally, between 1-2 am CDT, the line of severe storms cleared the far eastern edges of the local area near the Highway 81 corridor, leaving behind only a trailing zone of stratiform rain that lingered into the pre-dawn hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska by early evening. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the upper-80s to lower-90s F while dewpoints generally held in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/expanded the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.45,-99.33

515948,4/13/2014 16:15,54,MG,The wind gust was a combination of gradient wind enhanced by outflow from thunderstorms.,"Starting during the early morning hours on this Sunday and continuing well into the evening in eastern counties, a pronounced collision of spring and winter fueled a gamut of weather across South Central Nebraska. This included strong to marginally severe thunderstorms mainly in the southeast half of the 24-county area, near-blizzard conditions and several inches of wet, heavy snow mainly in the northwest half of the area, and also several hours of sustained north winds generally 30-35 MPH commonly gusting 40-50+ MPH. By far the biggest story of the day was the worse-than-expected combination of moderate to heavy snow and strong wind. Although travel became treacherous in several counties, a few of the most newsworthy issues included the closure of Interstate 80 between Kearney and Elm Creek and the opening of a warming shelter for stranded motorists in Holdrege. As for storm-total snowfall, the highest concentration of 3-6 amounts (and locally higher) occurred within a southwest-to northeast band centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from near Beaver City-Holdrege-Ravenna-Wolbach. Within this hardest-hit zone, a few of the highest snow totals from NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers featured 7.5 three miles west of Elba, 7.0 seven miles south of Litchfield and also four miles east-southeast of Sumner, 6.7 at Wolbach and 6.1 at St. Paul. Outside this primary snow band, including most locations south and southeast of a line from Franklin-Grand Island-York, accumulations averaged no more than 1-2. However, even these areas endured at least a brief bout of very poor visibilities in wind-blown snow. As for the timing of snow, it was a typical west-to-east transition from rain to snow with a brief period of sleet in between. The aforementioned, significant snow band that targeted western and northern counties produced most of its impacts between 11 AM-3 PM CDT, remaining quasi-stationary for several hours within a focused mid-level deformation zone. During the later afternoon and early evening hours, the band became much more progressive as it marched eastward through the remainder of South Central Nebraska, eventually exiting the eastern fringes of the local area between 8-10 PM CDT.   Before the wintry aspect of this system took center stage, convection was the initial focus of the day as primarily the southeast half of the 24-county area saw fairly widespread coverage of thunderstorms for the first time in 2014. Strong storms began flaring up mainly south of Interstate 80 between 6-8 AM CDT, with one storm producing hail up to quarter size in far eastern Fillmore County. Although no additional storms met severe-criteria, several produced copious amounts of small hail, resulting in a report of slick roadways in parts of Franklin County. Although the existing gradient wind across the area was already quite strong, the presence of thunderstorm outflow likely further-enhanced gusts, resulting in peak speeds to around 60 MPH as measured at the Kearney airport. Thunderstorm-enhanced winds likely also contributed to the destruction of a building under construction in eastern Franklin County. As increasingly-colder air surged across the area from west-to-east during the late morning and early afternoon hours, thunderstorms all but ended within the area by 2 PM CDT.   As earlier mentioned, this snow event ended up being much more impactful than anticipated, in part because most computer forecast models failed to predict the intense banding and also underestimated the speed and magnitude of cold air surging into the area. Furthermore, the heavy snowfall rates overwhelmed any melting influences from antecedent warm ground conditions. As testament to the stark weather changes associated with this system, afternoon high temperatures on the preceding afternoon of the 12th ranged from 76-80 F across most of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 13th, the powerful cold front had pushed well south of the area along an axis from southwest Kansas to southern Iowa, with temperatures across most of the local area already well down into the 40s F. By early afternoon when snow was well-underway, temperatures across the majority of South Central Nebraska had plunged to 30-35 F, promoting wind chill values generally 15-20 F. In the mid-upper levels, a longwave trough dominated much of the central United States and Nebraska resided under a favorable coupled upper jet regime within the exit region of a southern stream branch sliding across the Southern Plains and the entrance region of a northern stream jet centered from the eastern Dakotas into Canada. A bit lower in the troposphere, a pronounced zone of frontogenesis/deformation focused across the heart of South Central Nebraska along the path of a 700 millibar low pressure center and to the northwest of a closed 850 millibar low that tracked from southwest Kansas to southern Iowa. On a positive note, the combination of rain and snow brought much-needed liquid precipitation totals of 0.40-0.80 to the majority of the area, with amounts in excess of 1 common in the corridor of heaviest snow, highlighted by 1.98 at Holdrege. As is typical of April snow, it did not stick around long as high temperatures two days later bounced back into the 60s.",40.73,-99

Fortunately, these tornadoes were of the weak and brief variety (rated EF-0) and resulted in no reports of damage. The first tornado touched down shortly before 230 PM CDT in far northern Franklin County near Upland. The other two tornadoes occurred a few hours later between 430-530 PM, associated with the strongest, most organized supercell storm of the day as it tracked north through the far eastern counties of the local area. One of these tornadoes touched down north of Bradshaw in York County and the other in west-central Polk County several miles west-northwest of Osceola. As for hail reports, the majority of them originated from western Thayer and Fillmore and northern Adams counties, including some stones up to golf ball size. There were only a few reports of marginally severe winds, highlighted by a measured 62 MPH gust near Wood River.   All strong to severe thunderstorms within the 24-county area occurred between 12-6 PM CDT in association with a seasonably classic and powerful, vertically-stacked low pressure system migrating northeastward into South Central Nebraska. All severe storms also concentrated east and northeast of a Lexington-Franklin line, as the far southwestern counties were spared due to the passage of a well-defined, northward-drifting surface dryline and occluding cold front. There were essentially two primary areas and modes of severe storm development. The first, which accounted for most of the days thunderstorm activity, consisted of a broken arc of storms lifting north across mainly central and west-central portions of the area. Several individual cells within this arc drifted northwestward in sync with the counter-clockwise circulation of the parent low. The initial development got going over Dawson County between 12-1 PM CDT, but these storms yielded no reports of severe weather before departing the local area into Custer and Lincoln counties. Following a brief lull, the second and more dominant arc of convection flared up generally along an axis running from eastern Dawson to Webster counties between 130 PM and 3 PM CDT, during which time the first tornado occurred near Upland. Eventually, the eastern-most cells in the arc became the most intense as they lifted north-northwest, resulting in several hail reports along a path through counties including Adams, Hall and Sherman between 330 PM and 5 PM CDT before weakening and eventually departing the local area to the north. Meanwhile, the second primary area/mode of severe weather developed farther east, and revolved around an isolated supercell that developed over southwestern Thayer County around 230 PM CDT and then drifted almost due north for the next several hours, finally departing the local area out of far eastern Nance and Merrick counties around 6 PM CDT. This lone supercell produced both the York and Polk County tornadoes, along with several hail reports. Just to the east of this main supercell of the day, another briefly-severe storm affected far eastern York County around 5 PM CDT.  All strong-severe convection vacated the entire 24-county area by around 6 PM CDT, leaving behind only lingering stratiform rain in western counties under the core of the mid level low.  On the synoptic scale, the day began with a deep, vertically stacked closed low centered over central portions of the Kansas-Colorado border area as its 984 millibar surface low started to occlude. By early afternoon, severe storm development in South Central Nebraska focused within a corridor of steep low level lapse rates under the mid-level dry slot, with the southwestern extent of storm development defined by the leading edge of the northward-drifting occluded front/dryline. By late afternoon, the deep low had migrated to near McCook, allowing the surface front to push northward through all of South Central and ending the severe threat. Ahead of this occluded front/sharp dryline, surface-based CAPE climbed to around 1000 J/kg in an environment featuring surface dewpoints in the mid-upper 50s F. Behind the boundary, dewpoints quickly crashed into the 30s F.",40.81,-98.6

519881,6/4/2014 0:39,54,MG,nan,"For roughly the northeast half of this 24-county South Central Nebraska area, this late Tuesday afternoon and evening featured one of the most widespread severe weather events of the 2014 convective season. In essence, three separate waves of primarily outflow-dominant convection rolled across the area along a west-northwest to east-southeast path over the course of several hours, resulting in dozens of reports of large hail and damaging winds, along with three fairly brief tornadoes, two rated EF0 and one EF1. There was a notably sharp cutoff in severe thunderstorm activity within South Central Nebraska, as nearly all storms concentrated northeast of a line from roughly Litchfield-Hastings-Geneva, while most locations southwest of this line did not even observe a single raindrop. Starting with the three tornadoes, the first two were brief, EF0 touchdowns that occurred in far northern Valley and north central Greeley counties during the 415-515 pm CDT time frame, and were associated with the first supercell storm of the event that tracked into the local area from the west-northwest. These tornadoes produced little if any direct damage. The third confirmed tornado of the event was a bit more significant, and occurred several hours later after dark, around 1030 pm CDT in eastern Hamilton County north of Hampton. This EF1 tornado struck two homes, blowing a portion of the roof off of one of them. As for large hail, there were several reports of stones up to around golf ball size in places such as Spalding, Osceola, Arcadia, York, McCool Junction and Exeter. Many places were hit with more than one round of hail, including York, where golf ball size hail first fell around 830 pm CDT and then again around 11 pm CDT. In many cases, hail was accompanied by severe outflow winds of generally 60-80 MPH, resulting in broken windows and siding damage to several structures, along with tree damage. As just a few specific examples of wind reports and damage: Ord airport measured a 79 MPH gust, a rural residence four miles northeast of Scotia sustained considerable damage to outbuildings along with broken house windows, and a grocery store in Wolbach had its roof peeled back. In addition to damaging winds directly associated with severe storms, places farther south near the Highway 6 corridor, including Hastings, observed the passage of a notably strong, southward-surging outflow boundary around 8 pm CDT that produced measured 70+ MPH winds and significant blowing dust. At the time this outflow plowed through Hastings, the nearest precipitation associated with actual thunderstorms was at least 15-20 miles off to the north-northeast. As for event-total rainfall, most of the affected areas tallied somewhere between 1-3, although localized higher amounts occurred mainly in Nance and Polk counties, including NeRAIN observer totals of 3.70 two miles west-northwest of Shelby and 3.68 seven miles north of Osceola.   Taking a closer look at severe weather timing, the morning actually started out with a cluster of strong storms that rumbled through many of the same northern counties that would later see the main event. These early-day storms produced nickel size hail in Arcadia, but by 930 am CDT all morning activity had exited South Central Nebraska, kicking off a multi-hour lull. Then, generally between 430-630 pm CDT, round 1 of severe storms, anchored by an outflow-dominant supercell that produced the EF0 tornadoes, raked across mainly the far northern and northeastern fringes of the local area before exiting into eastern Nebraska. Around the time round 1 was exiting stage right, round 2 of severe storms entered Valley and Greeley counties from the northwest between 6-7 pm CDT and tracked east-southeast for the next few hours before exiting the eastern York County area around 9 pm CDT. Following a very similar theme, round 3 of severe storms initially intensified over the Valley/Sherman counties area between 830-930 pm CDT, and proceeded to pass east-southeast over many of the same areas as the previous round. However this final cluster of fairly fast-moving severe storms slipped a touch farther southeast, affecting more of the Fillmore County area before exiting into eastern Nebraska around 1230 am CDT on the 4th. Although a few non-severe storms lingered a bit later near the Interstate 80 corridor, essentially all of South Central Nebraska was finally storm-free by 230 am CDT.  On the mid-upper level synoptic scale, the main trigger for this event was an energetic, although fairly-low amplitude shortwave trough that raced out of the Intermountain West and into the Central Plains. A corresponding westerly mid-level speed max of around 60-70 knots at 500 millibars accompanied this wave, which combined with steepening mid level lapse rates and surface dewpoints generally in the low-mid 60s F to yield a fairly volatile late afternoon/early evening mesoscale environment featuring around 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and a notable 60-70 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear. Low level shear and storm-relative helicity also became quite pronounced in the vicinity of a fairly sharp surface warm front that became quasi-stationary through much of the day and evening along an axis through northwest-central-southeast Nebraska. Despite the considerable severe weather that occurred, there were indications leading up to the event that it could have been worse. For one thing, the mesoscale environment was initially supportive of more destructive, longer-track tornadoes, but this threat steadily diminished as most storms quickly became outflow-dominant and generated a larger-scale cold pool. Secondly, the areal coverage of severe storms was not as widespread as it could have been, as a mid level capping inversion south of the strong warm front spared most of the southwest half of the local area from observing any convection. At any rate, this severe weather event was well-anticipated at least a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",41.31,-98.17

Around the time round 1 was exiting stage right, round 2 of severe storms entered Valley and Greeley counties from the northwest between 6-7 pm CDT and tracked east-southeast for the next few hours before exiting the eastern York County area around 9 pm CDT. Following a very similar theme, round 3 of severe storms initially intensified over the Valley/Sherman counties area between 830-930 pm CDT, and proceeded to pass east-southeast over many of the same areas as the previous round. However this final cluster of fairly fast-moving severe storms slipped a touch farther southeast, affecting more of the Fillmore County area before exiting into eastern Nebraska around 1230 am CDT on the 4th. Although a few non-severe storms lingered a bit later near the Interstate 80 corridor, essentially all of South Central Nebraska was finally storm-free by 230 am CDT.  On the mid-upper level synoptic scale, the main trigger for this event was an energetic, although fairly-low amplitude shortwave trough that raced out of the Intermountain West and into the Central Plains. A corresponding westerly mid-level speed max of around 60-70 knots at 500 millibars accompanied this wave, which combined with steepening mid level lapse rates and surface dewpoints generally in the low-mid 60s F to yield a fairly volatile late afternoon/early evening mesoscale environment featuring around 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and a notable 60-70 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear. Low level shear and storm-relative helicity also became quite pronounced in the vicinity of a fairly sharp surface warm front that became quasi-stationary through much of the day and evening along an axis through northwest-central-southeast Nebraska. Despite the considerable severe weather that occurred, there were indications leading up to the event that it could have been worse. For one thing, the mesoscale environment was initially supportive of more destructive, longer-track tornadoes, but this threat steadily diminished as most storms quickly became outflow-dominant and generated a larger-scale cold pool. Secondly, the areal coverage of severe storms was not as widespread as it could have been, as a mid level capping inversion south of the strong warm front spared most of the southwest half of the local area from observing any convection. At any rate, this severe weather event was well-anticipated at least a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.88,-97.58

524760,6/15/2014 3:51,54,MG,This wind gust was measured by a Nebraska Department of Roads mesonet site.,"During a month that had several rounds of severe weather in South Central Nebraska, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east through most locations near and south of Interstate 80 during the later evening. Earlier in the event, more discrete convection resulted primarily in numerous reports of severe-criteria hail, some as large as tennis ball to grapefruit size, along with four confirmed, brief EF0 tornadoes that yielded no reports of damage. The first of these tornadoes occurred in northwestern Franklin County near Hildreth around 730 pm CDT. The other three tornadoes were associated with a supercell storm that drifted northeast out of Kansas along a path from Webster to Hamilton counties before being absorbed into a larger line of convection. The first of these tornadoes was sighted in far southwestern Webster County around 830 pm CDT while the final two brief touchdowns occurred after nightfall in southwestern Hamilton County between Trumbull and Giltner between 1000-1030 pm CDT. In terms of hail, the largest confirmed stone of 4.25 fell three miles southeast of Hastings around 930 pm CDT. Other notable hail reports included stones up to baseball size along the Nance-Merrick County line, in and near Gibbon, near Ayr and in Arapahoe. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across roughly the southern half of the 24-county area later in the evening ended up being the big story of this event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through essentially all areas between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 82 MPH by a storm chaser near the Interstate 80 York exit, 79 MPH at Hastings airport, and 76 MPH at home weather stations near Davenport and Ohiowa. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and also damaged several structures, including outbuildings, grain bins and power poles. To cite just a few examples of this damage as it progressed from west to east: at Harlan County Lake at least four small boats were rammed into the shore and a camping trailer was overturned onto a vehicle, in Guide Rock a garage was blown off its foundation and partially onto a roadway, and at the Nuckolls County fairgrounds in Nelson a tin roof was removed from a barn, the roof of the arena was damaged and a camper was flipped on its side. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most storms, rainfall totals across much of South Central Nebraska did not exceed 1-2 inches. However, a southwest-to-northeast corridor of 2-3 and locally higher rainfall centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Wilcox-Grand Island-Genoa, featuring NeRAIN observer totals of 4.13 three miles west-southwest of Genoa and 4.06 two miles of Doniphan.  Breaking down event timing, the initial round of at least semi-discrete convection, including a few supercells, flared up between 530-730 pm CDT within a fairly narrow southwest-to-northeast oriented corridor along a slow-moving but well-defined cold front. Most of this early convection concentrated several miles either side of a line from near Franklin and Red Cloud in the south, then north-northeast through the Hastings-Grand Island-Central City-Fullerton areas. Generally between 730-930 pm CDT, this initially narrow corridor of storms gradually expanded in coverage to both the west and east. Then, even as ongoing convection remained strong to severe, the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of southwest Nebraska, entering southwestern portions of the local area between 930-1030 pm CDT. For the next few hours generally between 1030 pm to 1 am CDT, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of roughly the southern half of South Central Nebraska, while the far northern end of the line gradually merged with the earlier convection that had largely lifted north of Interstate 80 by this time and had weakened somewhat. Finally, between 1-2 am CDT, the line of severe storms cleared the far eastern edges of the local area near the Highway 81 corridor, leaving behind only a trailing zone of stratiform rain that lingered into the pre-dawn hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska by early evening. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the upper-80s to lower-90s F while dewpoints generally held in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/expanded the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.69,-99.38

539555,8/18/2014 1:52,54,MG,Wind gust was measured at the Hastings NWS Office.,"During a four-hour period centered from 630-1030 pm CDT on this Sunday evening, a complex of severe thunderstorms tracked from northwest-to-southeast through primarily the southwestern two-thirds of South Central Nebraska, resulting in numerous reports of damaging winds ranging from 60 to around 80 MPH. Hail was not a significant issue, with nickel size stones being the largest reported. Although high winds also affected some counties farther west, the primary swath of damaging winds was roughly 20-40 miles wide, extending from the Valley/Sherman counties area in the northwest, southeastward through the Hall/Adams/Nuckolls counties areas. Along this main corridor, a sampling of the most wind significant reports in chronological order included: estimated 70 MPH winds in the Elyria and Litchfield areas with crop and tree damage, a measured 71 MPH gust near Wood River, a measured peak gust of 83 MPH at Hastings airport along with 10-20 minutes of persistent 60-80 MPH wind behind the initial surge, and up to 30 minutes of estimated 60-70 MPH gusts in Superior. Off to the west of this main zone of wind issues, there were a few reports of gusts around 60 MPH in the Lexington and Arapahoe areas. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection kept totals in most places no higher than 0.50-1.50 inches, with a few of the wetter exceptions per NeRAIN observes featuring 2.30 nine miles northwest of Ord and 2.13 six miles southeast of Davenport.   In a basic sense, this event consisted of an initially semi-discrete supercell cluster that first developed in north central Nebraska during the mid-afternoon hours and then gradually grew upscale into a larger-scale, forward-propagating linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) as it crossed the local South Central Nebraska area. This intense storm complex first infiltrated the local area into Valley/Sherman/Dawson counties between 630-730 pm CDT, blew through the Grand Island/Hastings areas during the 815-930 pm CDT time frame and finally departed southeastward into northern Kansas between 10-11 pm CDT. Although showers/weak storms lingered over mainly eastern counties a bit longer, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska was void of precipitation by 1 am CDT on the 18th.   By late-summer standards, this synoptic and mesoscale setup was fairly ripe for an organized severe weather event. In the mid-upper levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough brushed into Nebraska from the northwest, along the southern periphery of a larger scale disturbance centered over southern Saskatchewan/Manitoba. As a result, mid-upper level flow increased enough to promote generally 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear over South Central Nebraska. In addition, instability was quite potent as the combination of afternoon surface temperatures in the upper-80s/near 90 F and dewpoints in the mid-60s/low-70s promoted mixed-layer CAPE values of 2000-4000 J/kg ahead of the incoming convective complex.",40.6379,-98.38

525250,6/15/2014 5:30,55,MG,This 63 MPH wind gust was measured on a mobile wind instrument.,"During a month that had several rounds of severe weather in South Central Nebraska, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east through most locations near and south of Interstate 80 during the later evening. Earlier in the event, more discrete convection resulted primarily in numerous reports of severe-criteria hail, some as large as tennis ball to grapefruit size, along with four confirmed, brief EF0 tornadoes that yielded no reports of damage. The first of these tornadoes occurred in northwestern Franklin County near Hildreth around 730 pm CDT. The other three tornadoes were associated with a supercell storm that drifted northeast out of Kansas along a path from Webster to Hamilton counties before being absorbed into a larger line of convection. The first of these tornadoes was sighted in far southwestern Webster County around 830 pm CDT while the final two brief touchdowns occurred after nightfall in southwestern Hamilton County between Trumbull and Giltner between 1000-1030 pm CDT. In terms of hail, the largest confirmed stone of 4.25 fell three miles southeast of Hastings around 930 pm CDT. Other notable hail reports included stones up to baseball size along the Nance-Merrick County line, in and near Gibbon, near Ayr and in Arapahoe. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across roughly the southern half of the 24-county area later in the evening ended up being the big story of this event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through essentially all areas between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 82 MPH by a storm chaser near the Interstate 80 York exit, 79 MPH at Hastings airport, and 76 MPH at home weather stations near Davenport and Ohiowa. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and also damaged several structures, including outbuildings, grain bins and power poles. To cite just a few examples of this damage as it progressed from west to east: at Harlan County Lake at least four small boats were rammed into the shore and a camping trailer was overturned onto a vehicle, in Guide Rock a garage was blown off its foundation and partially onto a roadway, and at the Nuckolls County fairgrounds in Nelson a tin roof was removed from a barn, the roof of the arena was damaged and a camper was flipped on its side. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most storms, rainfall totals across much of South Central Nebraska did not exceed 1-2 inches. However, a southwest-to-northeast corridor of 2-3 and locally higher rainfall centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Wilcox-Grand Island-Genoa, featuring NeRAIN observer totals of 4.13 three miles west-southwest of Genoa and 4.06 two miles of Doniphan.  Breaking down event timing, the initial round of at least semi-discrete convection, including a few supercells, flared up between 530-730 pm CDT within a fairly narrow southwest-to-northeast oriented corridor along a slow-moving but well-defined cold front. Most of this early convection concentrated several miles either side of a line from near Franklin and Red Cloud in the south, then north-northeast through the Hastings-Grand Island-Central City-Fullerton areas. Generally between 730-930 pm CDT, this initially narrow corridor of storms gradually expanded in coverage to both the west and east. Then, even as ongoing convection remained strong to severe, the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of southwest Nebraska, entering southwestern portions of the local area between 930-1030 pm CDT. For the next few hours generally between 1030 pm to 1 am CDT, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of roughly the southern half of South Central Nebraska, while the far northern end of the line gradually merged with the earlier convection that had largely lifted north of Interstate 80 by this time and had weakened somewhat. Finally, between 1-2 am CDT, the line of severe storms cleared the far eastern edges of the local area near the Highway 81 corridor, leaving behind only a trailing zone of stratiform rain that lingered into the pre-dawn hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska by early evening. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the upper-80s to lower-90s F while dewpoints generally held in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/expanded the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.69,-97.6

539538,8/18/2014 2:30,55,MG,nan,"During a 3.5 hour period centered from 7-1030 pm CDT on this Sunday evening, a pair of strong to severe linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS) affected this six-county North Central Kansas area and merged with each other in the process. These storms were primarily damaging wind-producers. However, the one known severe-criteria hail report was a significant one as golf ball to softball size stones occurred near Agra. Wind-wise, the initial storm complex that moved into the area from northwest Kansas yielded severe-criteria measured gusts at Logan (58 MPH) and Phillipsburg airport (67 MPH). A bit later in the evening, following the merger of the first storm complex with a stronger, larger MCS diving southeastward out of south central Nebraska, Jewell and Mitchell counties bore the brunt of damaging winds including estimated 70 MPH winds in Mankato, a measured 86 MPH gust near Jewell, and a report of tree branches downed throughout Beloit. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection held amounts under 1 inch in most places.    Timing-wise, the first storm complex tracked into Phillips and Rooks counties from the west between 7-8 pm CDT, having grown upscale from its humble late-afternoon beginnings along western portions of the Kansas-Nebraska border. As this initial area of convection reached far eastern portions of Smith and Osborne counties around 930 pm CDT, its northern end quickly merged with the leading edges of a stronger linear MCS charging southeastward out of Nebraska. During the ensuing hour, strong to severe winds swept through Jewell and Mitchell counties before departing the local area to the east and southeast. Although showers/weak storms lingered over some places a bit longer, the vast majority of the local area was void of precipitation by 1230 am CDT on the 18th.   By late-summer standards, this synoptic and mesoscale setup was fairly ripe for an organized severe weather event. In the mid-upper levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough brushed into the Central Plains from the northwest, along the southern periphery of a larger scale disturbance centered over southern Saskatchewan/Manitoba. As a result, mid-upper level flow increased enough to promote generally 30-35 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear over North Central Kansas. In addition, instability was quite potent as the combination of afternoon surface temperatures in the 90s F and dewpoints in the 60s promoted mixed-layer CAPE values of 2000-4000 J/kg ahead of the incoming convective complexes.",39.73,-99.32

At Webster State Park, a number of campers were blown over and one cabin suffered roof damage.","During a month with several rounds of severe weather in this six-county portion of North Central Kansas, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east across the area in the form of an intense forward-propagating squall line. A few hours prior to these severe winds entering the local area, an isolated supercell storm cluster drifted slowly northeast across parts of Rooks, Phillips and Smith counties before departing into Nebraska, producing one highly-visible, short-track landspout tornado and a few reports of quarter to golf ball size hail. The EF1-rated tornado, which touched down around 530 pm CDT near Webster State Park shortly after storms first initiated, damaged power poles and fencing along its brief path. In terms of hail, the largest reported golf ball size stones fell in the Glade area shortly after the dissipation of the Rooks County tornado. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across the six-county area later in the evening was truly the main event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through nearly every square mile of North Central Kansas. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 86 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport and 77 MPH at a home weather station near Webber. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and likely also damaged several structures. Based on a limited number of damage reports that were received, one of the more newsworthy incidents involved several campers blown over at Webster State Park, along with a roof blown off a cabin. Due to the progressive nature of these storms, rainfall totals across most of North Central Kansas averaged less than 1.   Breaking down event timing, the initial supercell cluster that produced the landspout tornado in northern Rooks County flared up between 5-6 pm CDT near the leading edge of the invading cold front. As this storm cluster slowly drifted northeast through Smith County, it evolved into a more compact-but-organized discrete supercell that exited northward into Nebraska around 830 pm CDT. This storms departure ushered in a nearly two-hour lull in local thunderstorm activity, before the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of northwest Kansas into Phillips and Rooks counties between 10-11 pm CDT. For the next few hours, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of the six-county area before gradually departing the eastern edges of Jewell and Mitchell counties between 12-1 am CDT, leaving behind only a trailing area of stratiform rain that lingered for a few more hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged southeastward into North Central Kansas during the evening, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the low-mid 90s F while dewpoints generally averaged in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed much of North Central Kansas in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",39.4154,-99.433

519960,6/4/2014 1:08,56,MG,nan,"For roughly the northeast half of this 24-county South Central Nebraska area, this late Tuesday afternoon and evening featured one of the most widespread severe weather events of the 2014 convective season. In essence, three separate waves of primarily outflow-dominant convection rolled across the area along a west-northwest to east-southeast path over the course of several hours, resulting in dozens of reports of large hail and damaging winds, along with three fairly brief tornadoes, two rated EF0 and one EF1. There was a notably sharp cutoff in severe thunderstorm activity within South Central Nebraska, as nearly all storms concentrated northeast of a line from roughly Litchfield-Hastings-Geneva, while most locations southwest of this line did not even observe a single raindrop. Starting with the three tornadoes, the first two were brief, EF0 touchdowns that occurred in far northern Valley and north central Greeley counties during the 415-515 pm CDT time frame, and were associated with the first supercell storm of the event that tracked into the local area from the west-northwest. These tornadoes produced little if any direct damage. The third confirmed tornado of the event was a bit more significant, and occurred several hours later after dark, around 1030 pm CDT in eastern Hamilton County north of Hampton. This EF1 tornado struck two homes, blowing a portion of the roof off of one of them. As for large hail, there were several reports of stones up to around golf ball size in places such as Spalding, Osceola, Arcadia, York, McCool Junction and Exeter. Many places were hit with more than one round of hail, including York, where golf ball size hail first fell around 830 pm CDT and then again around 11 pm CDT. In many cases, hail was accompanied by severe outflow winds of generally 60-80 MPH, resulting in broken windows and siding damage to several structures, along with tree damage. As just a few specific examples of wind reports and damage: Ord airport measured a 79 MPH gust, a rural residence four miles northeast of Scotia sustained considerable damage to outbuildings along with broken house windows, and a grocery store in Wolbach had its roof peeled back. In addition to damaging winds directly associated with severe storms, places farther south near the Highway 6 corridor, including Hastings, observed the passage of a notably strong, southward-surging outflow boundary around 8 pm CDT that produced measured 70+ MPH winds and significant blowing dust. At the time this outflow plowed through Hastings, the nearest precipitation associated with actual thunderstorms was at least 15-20 miles off to the north-northeast. As for event-total rainfall, most of the affected areas tallied somewhere between 1-3, although localized higher amounts occurred mainly in Nance and Polk counties, including NeRAIN observer totals of 3.70 two miles west-northwest of Shelby and 3.68 seven miles north of Osceola.   Taking a closer look at severe weather timing, the morning actually started out with a cluster of strong storms that rumbled through many of the same northern counties that would later see the main event. These early-day storms produced nickel size hail in Arcadia, but by 930 am CDT all morning activity had exited South Central Nebraska, kicking off a multi-hour lull. Then, generally between 430-630 pm CDT, round 1 of severe storms, anchored by an outflow-dominant supercell that produced the EF0 tornadoes, raked across mainly the far northern and northeastern fringes of the local area before exiting into eastern Nebraska. Around the time round 1 was exiting stage right, round 2 of severe storms entered Valley and Greeley counties from the northwest between 6-7 pm CDT and tracked east-southeast for the next few hours before exiting the eastern York County area around 9 pm CDT. Following a very similar theme, round 3 of severe storms initially intensified over the Valley/Sherman counties area between 830-930 pm CDT, and proceeded to pass east-southeast over many of the same areas as the previous round. However this final cluster of fairly fast-moving severe storms slipped a touch farther southeast, affecting more of the Fillmore County area before exiting into eastern Nebraska around 1230 am CDT on the 4th. Although a few non-severe storms lingered a bit later near the Interstate 80 corridor, essentially all of South Central Nebraska was finally storm-free by 230 am CDT.  On the mid-upper level synoptic scale, the main trigger for this event was an energetic, although fairly-low amplitude shortwave trough that raced out of the Intermountain West and into the Central Plains. A corresponding westerly mid-level speed max of around 60-70 knots at 500 millibars accompanied this wave, which combined with steepening mid level lapse rates and surface dewpoints generally in the low-mid 60s F to yield a fairly volatile late afternoon/early evening mesoscale environment featuring around 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and a notable 60-70 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear. Low level shear and storm-relative helicity also became quite pronounced in the vicinity of a fairly sharp surface warm front that became quasi-stationary through much of the day and evening along an axis through northwest-central-southeast Nebraska. Despite the considerable severe weather that occurred, there were indications leading up to the event that it could have been worse. For one thing, the mesoscale environment was initially supportive of more destructive, longer-track tornadoes, but this threat steadily diminished as most storms quickly became outflow-dominant and generated a larger-scale cold pool. Secondly, the areal coverage of severe storms was not as widespread as it could have been, as a mid level capping inversion south of the strong warm front spared most of the southwest half of the local area from observing any convection. At any rate, this severe weather event was well-anticipated at least a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",41.23,-97.71

Additional thunderstorms developed ahead of and behind this initial wave, also producing severe weather. Additional supercells developed in central Nebraska and moved into southeast Nebraska during the evening hours. The severe weather ended after midnight across the area.

539624,8/10/2014 3:32,56,MG,nan,"For the second consecutive night, widespread thunderstorm activity blossomed across most all of the 24-county South Central Nebraska area on this Saturday, although just like the previous night all severe-criteria hail and wind reports emanated from counties along and west of the Highway 281 corridor. Early in the evening, an isolated severe storm dropped torrential rainfall and hail up to golf ball size over central Franklin County. Thereafter, the majority of severe weather later in the evening was associated with a pair of southeastward-surging storm clusters. The western-most one peaked in intensity over Dawson and western Buffalo counties, highlighted by reports of quarter to golf ball size hail in the Elm Creek area and golf ball to baseball size hail in the Lexington area. A bit farther east and a bit later, a separate severe storm cluster was more of a damaging wind producer as it raced through southern Hall and Adams counties and portions of neighboring counties. In these areas, estimated 60 MPH winds were reported in the Ayr and Bladen areas, and more significant peak gusts of slightly over 70 MPH were measured near Wood River and at Hastings airport, resulting in reports of a few large tree limbs down in the city. Fortunately for the majority of South Central Nebraska, most storms on this night produced only sub-severe wind gusts and non-flooding rainfall mainly under 1.50 inches. Localized pockets of the area measured higher rainfall amounts, but none more so than a small zone of very heavy rain up to around 6 that fell in east-central Franklin County, most of which from the aforementioned, slow-moving early evening storm.   Breaking down the timing of thunderstorm evolution in more detail, its worth noting that well-before the onset of the evening main event several strong thunderstorms rumbled across the far northern/northeastern fringes of the local area for much of the day. Although radar suggested a few of these daytime storms may have produced larger hail (especially in northern Valley/Greeley counties), limited ground-truth reports yielded no larger than dime size stones. The primary evening event got underway between 630-730 pm CDT as a slow-moving, isolated severe storm blew up over Franklin County before eventually departing southeastward into northern Kansas. As the Franklin County storm was in progress, a southeastward-surging supercell cluster entered the local area from Custer County between 730-830 pm CDT, primarily impacting Dawson County and vicinity. Over the next few hours, this initial severe storm cluster weakened while a plethora of additional multicell and linear thunderstorm complexes blossomed over the majority of South Central Nebraska. While much of this activity was sub-severe, a second southeast-surging storm complex produced the damaging winds in the Hall/Adams counties area between 10-11 pm CDT. After 11 pm CDT, all storms in South Central Nebraska exhibited a steady weakening trend although widespread showers and embedded thunderstorms lingered well past midnight in many areas.   This was a fairly typical late-summer severe weather event featuring fairly high instability values but only modest deep layer wind shear and weak large scale forcing. In the mid to upper levels, generally quasi-zonal flow was in place over the Central Plains, containing one or more fairly subtle shortwave troughs. At the surface, storms during the main evening event initiated in the vicinity of a northwest-southeast oriented quasi stationary front draped from western Nebraska into north central Kansas, with this front partially composed of a remnant outflow boundary from the previous nights convection. With surface dewpoints well into the mid-60s to low-70s F across the local area, most-unstable CAPE climbed as high as 2000-3000 J/kg. Although a few storms briefly exhibited supercell structures, 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear only averaging around 30 knots promoted a predominant multicell/quasi-linear mode.",40.609,-98.38
539549,8/18/2014 1:29,56,MG,nan,"During a four-hour period centered from 630-1030 pm CDT on this Sunday evening, a complex of severe thunderstorms tracked from northwest-to-southeast through primarily the southwestern two-thirds of South Central Nebraska, resulting in numerous reports of damaging winds ranging from 60 to around 80 MPH. Hail was not a significant issue, with nickel size stones being the largest reported. Although high winds also affected some counties farther west, the primary swath of damaging winds was roughly 20-40 miles wide, extending from the Valley/Sherman counties area in the northwest, southeastward through the Hall/Adams/Nuckolls counties areas. Along this main corridor, a sampling of the most wind significant reports in chronological order included: estimated 70 MPH winds in the Elyria and Litchfield areas with crop and tree damage, a measured 71 MPH gust near Wood River, a measured peak gust of 83 MPH at Hastings airport along with 10-20 minutes of persistent 60-80 MPH wind behind the initial surge, and up to 30 minutes of estimated 60-70 MPH gusts in Superior. Off to the west of this main zone of wind issues, there were a few reports of gusts around 60 MPH in the Lexington and Arapahoe areas. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection kept totals in most places no higher than 0.50-1.50 inches, with a few of the wetter exceptions per NeRAIN observes featuring 2.30 nine miles northwest of Ord and 2.13 six miles southeast of Davenport.   In a basic sense, this event consisted of an initially semi-discrete supercell cluster that first developed in north central Nebraska during the mid-afternoon hours and then gradually grew upscale into a larger-scale, forward-propagating linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) as it crossed the local South Central Nebraska area. This intense storm complex first infiltrated the local area into Valley/Sherman/Dawson counties between 630-730 pm CDT, blew through the Grand Island/Hastings areas during the 815-930 pm CDT time frame and finally departed southeastward into northern Kansas between 10-11 pm CDT. Although showers/weak storms lingered over mainly eastern counties a bit longer, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska was void of precipitation by 1 am CDT on the 18th.   By late-summer standards, this synoptic and mesoscale setup was fairly ripe for an organized severe weather event. In the mid-upper levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough brushed into Nebraska from the northwest, along the southern periphery of a larger scale disturbance centered over southern Saskatchewan/Manitoba. As a result, mid-upper level flow increased enough to promote generally 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear over South Central Nebraska. In addition, instability was quite potent as the combination of afternoon surface temperatures in the upper-80s/near 90 F and dewpoints in the mid-60s/low-70s promoted mixed-layer CAPE values of 2000-4000 J/kg ahead of the incoming convective complex.",40.5005,-98.7531

Thunderstorms formed in an arching line ahead of the approaching upper low.  Though most of the storms were not severe, one became severe in Bremer County with a wind gust of 65 MPH in the Plainfield area.  Several trees were blown down and small hail also covered the ground.  Thunderstorms continued to develop in the warm air advection zone.  High winds damaged cars, a house, and trees in the Lake Mills area of Winnebago County.  A funnel cloud was observed northwest of Fonda in Pocahontas County.",42.84,-92.54
531707,9/1/2014 2:20,56,MG,nan,"An unstable airmass was in place across Iowa with afternoon highs reaching well into the 80s, and dewpoint readings in the low to mid 70s. CAPE rose to 2000 to 3000 J/kg. Downdraft CAPE was around 900 to 1000 J/kg, with CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere in the 600 to 900 J/kg range. Precipitable water increased to around 1.75 inches. The freezing level was quite high at around 15,000 feet. Fairly strong shear was present with 40 to 50 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  These parameters led to an unusual event across Iowa with numerous relatively short track tornadoes along with several reports of straight line wind damage.    The event started when a line of thunderstorms formed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa then moved east across the state through the evening hours. Hail with the storms was generally quite small. One inch diameter hail fell in Crawford County in Dow City.  However, high winds were much more common as the MCS progressed across the state. Several locations reported gusts of 60 MPH or higher. An 80 MPH gust was reported in Guthrie County at Yale and Bayard. A 71 MPH wind gust occurred in Marion County. Heavy rainfall was also of significance with flash flooding in Crawford County. This was caused by a dam failure which flooded Highway 39. Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes in Dallas County. There were numerous reports of around 2 inches of rain falling in Boone and Polk Counties. Water ponding and low-land flooding was common. One person was struck by lightning at the Denison Airport. The person received minor injuries. Additional heavy rainfall events are included on 01 September 2014 entry.  The most impressive aspect of this episode was the unusual number of tornadoes documented via high resolution aerial imagery.  A total of 35 tornadoes were found across all of Iowa including 32 in the Des Moines forecast area and another 3 in the La Crosse forecast area in northeast Iowa.  While many of these tornadoes remained in rural areas producing only crop damage, 15 of them produced some sort of property damage on farmsteads or confinement operations.  Only two of the tornadoes were reported during or shortly after the event with the remainder found nearly a year later via high resolution aerial imagery.

525224,6/15/2014 3:27,57,MG,nan,"During a month with several rounds of severe weather in this six-county portion of North Central Kansas, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east across the area in the form of an intense forward-propagating squall line. A few hours prior to these severe winds entering the local area, an isolated supercell storm cluster drifted slowly northeast across parts of Rooks, Phillips and Smith counties before departing into Nebraska, producing one highly-visible, short-track landspout tornado and a few reports of quarter to golf ball size hail. The EF1-rated tornado, which touched down around 530 pm CDT near Webster State Park shortly after storms first initiated, damaged power poles and fencing along its brief path. In terms of hail, the largest reported golf ball size stones fell in the Glade area shortly after the dissipation of the Rooks County tornado. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across the six-county area later in the evening was truly the main event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through nearly every square mile of North Central Kansas. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 86 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport and 77 MPH at a home weather station near Webber. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and likely also damaged several structures. Based on a limited number of damage reports that were received, one of the more newsworthy incidents involved several campers blown over at Webster State Park, along with a roof blown off a cabin. Due to the progressive nature of these storms, rainfall totals across most of North Central Kansas averaged less than 1.   Breaking down event timing, the initial supercell cluster that produced the landspout tornado in northern Rooks County flared up between 5-6 pm CDT near the leading edge of the invading cold front. As this storm cluster slowly drifted northeast through Smith County, it evolved into a more compact-but-organized discrete supercell that exited northward into Nebraska around 830 pm CDT. This storms departure ushered in a nearly two-hour lull in local thunderstorm activity, before the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of northwest Kansas into Phillips and Rooks counties between 10-11 pm CDT. For the next few hours, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of the six-county area before gradually departing the eastern edges of Jewell and Mitchell counties between 12-1 am CDT, leaving behind only a trailing area of stratiform rain that lingered for a few more hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged southeastward into North Central Kansas during the evening, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the low-mid 90s F while dewpoints generally averaged in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed much of North Central Kansas in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",39.67,-99.57

Although radar signatures and automated wind sensors indicated that a few storms were likely strong to potentially marginally severe, ground-truth storm reports were quite scarce during these overnight hours. The only verifiable report of severe weather in the local area occurred in the form of a measured 66 MPH gust at the Ord airport shortly before 3 am CDT, as a small but vigorous line of storms surged into Valley County and vicinity from the southwest. Shortly after producing these strong winds, this convective line steadily weakened and the severe threat subsided.  As for convective evolution during the evening and overnight hours, the first isolated strong storm crossed out of Kansas into Harlan and Franklin counties between 9-10 pm CDT. Renewed strong development along the eastern periphery of this initial storm lifted northeast through the Hastings and Aurora areas through around midnight CDT before weakening. Meanwhile, a separate, semi-organized line of strong storms gradually developed east-northeast out of western Nebraska into western and northern portions of South Central Nebraska mainly between 1230 am and 3 am CDT. During this time frame, the northern part of this line briefly intensified into a small-scale bowing segment, producing the severe winds in the Ord area. Through the remainder of the night, a cluster of fairly weak thunderstorms rumbled eastward across the majority of South Central Nebraska before dissipating and/or exiting eastward by around sunrise. In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, overnight convection was driven by a series of low amplitude disturbances ejecting northeastward across the Central Plains in south-southwesterly flow, well to the southeast of a parent closed mid level low anchored over the Montana-Alberta-Saskatchewan border area. At the surface, most convection concentrated along and just behind a slow-moving cold front drifting west-to-east across South Central Nebraska.

531709,9/1/2014 2:25,57,MG,nan,"An unstable airmass was in place across Iowa with afternoon highs reaching well into the 80s, and dewpoint readings in the low to mid 70s. CAPE rose to 2000 to 3000 J/kg. Downdraft CAPE was around 900 to 1000 J/kg, with CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere in the 600 to 900 J/kg range. Precipitable water increased to around 1.75 inches. The freezing level was quite high at around 15,000 feet. Fairly strong shear was present with 40 to 50 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  These parameters led to an unusual event across Iowa with numerous relatively short track tornadoes along with several reports of straight line wind damage.    The event started when a line of thunderstorms formed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa then moved east across the state through the evening hours. Hail with the storms was generally quite small. One inch diameter hail fell in Crawford County in Dow City.  However, high winds were much more common as the MCS progressed across the state. Several locations reported gusts of 60 MPH or higher. An 80 MPH gust was reported in Guthrie County at Yale and Bayard. A 71 MPH wind gust occurred in Marion County. Heavy rainfall was also of significance with flash flooding in Crawford County. This was caused by a dam failure which flooded Highway 39. Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes in Dallas County. There were numerous reports of around 2 inches of rain falling in Boone and Polk Counties. Water ponding and low-land flooding was common. One person was struck by lightning at the Denison Airport. The person received minor injuries. Additional heavy rainfall events are included on 01 September 2014 entry.  The most impressive aspect of this episode was the unusual number of tornadoes documented via high resolution aerial imagery.  A total of 35 tornadoes were found across all of Iowa including 32 in the Des Moines forecast area and another 3 in the La Crosse forecast area in northeast Iowa.  While many of these tornadoes remained in rural areas producing only crop damage, 15 of them produced some sort of property damage on farmsteads or confinement operations.  Only two of the tornadoes were reported during or shortly after the event with the remainder found nearly a year later via high resolution aerial imagery.  This makes it a unique if not unprecedented tornado event in terms of using aerial imagery for tornado detection in the United States.   This event also is the record for the number of tornadoes in one day for the state of Iowa to date.",42.47,-93.26
543703,10/2/2014 2:25,57,MG,nan,"This Wednesday evening into early Thursday morning featured South Central Nebraskas last bout of strong to severe thunderstorms in 2014. Although radar data suggested that isolated severe convection lingered into the early morning hours of the 2nd, all ground-truth severe weather reports occurred on the 1st between 730-1130 pm CDT, in areas west of Highway 14 and south of Highway 92. The highlight of the evening was an elevated supercell that tracked east generally down Highway 6 through Adams and Clay counties between 8-10 pm CDT, yielding numerous reports of hail up to half dollar size in places including Hastings. Along with the hail, this storm produced strong to marginally severe wind including measured gusts of 55 MPH at Hastings airport and 66 MPH at a mesonet site five miles southwest of Harvard. Not surprisingly, this combination of hail and wind damaged siding on area homes. Outside the path of this primary severe storm, there were several other quarter size hail reports during the evening, including near Naponee and Franklin in Franklin County and at Amherst and near Miller in Buffalo County. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most convection, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 0.50-1.00 inch of rain, although small pockets topped out closer to two inches, including 1.88 two miles west of Kenesaw (NeRAIN).   Taking a closer look at convective mode and timing, the first isolated strong to severe storms flared up between 630-800 pm CDT within various central counties including Franklin, Kearney, Adams and Buffalo. As this initial isolated activity drifted east or northeast during the ensuing few hours, by far the most organized storm was the one over Adams/Clay counties, which assumed elevated supercell characteristics. A bit later in the evening mainly between 10 pm-12 am CDT, another isolated strong to severe storm drifted across northeastern Dawson and northern Buffalo counties. However, the main feature of the later evening and post-midnight hours was a north-to-south oriented squall line that first entered far western portions of South Central Nebraska between 11 pm-12 am CDT. Initially, it appeared this convective line might become legitimately severe, but in fact it yielded only a few reports of sub-severe hail and wind as it limped into the Highway 281 corridor counties by 2 am CDT. Just as it appeared any severe threat might be over with for the night, the southern end of the line morphed into a semi-discrete, radar-indicated severe storm that tracked across mainly southern portions of Webster, Nuckolls and Thayer counties between 2-4 am CDT before exiting the local area. However, this storm yielded no verifying ground-truth reports, and in its wake, only scattered showers and a few very weak thunderstorms lingered over South Central Nebraska through the remainder of the night.    On the synoptic scale aloft, this early-autumn severe event focused just downstream from a sharpening mid-upper trough axis aligned from the far western Dakotas to the Four Corners region at midnight. Some of the initial early-evening convection was likely aided by subtle forcing from a weak lead wave out ahead of this parent trough. At the surface during the evening, forcing for convection was also rather nebulous, although a weak trough axis was draped through the general area. Toward midnight and through the early morning hours of the 2nd, a more organized cold front pushed through South Central Nebraska and helped promote the increasing areal coverage of convection. Instability-wise, this was not an overly-favorable setup for severe weather as surface dewpoints only averaged in the mid-50s F and most-unstable CAPE only peaked around 1000 J/kg. However, 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear was fairly strong at generally 40-50 knots, helping to enhance storm organization.",40.57,-98.16

An extremely unstable air mass was over the area on June 16 along with strong deep layer shear.  This allowed scattered supercells to form during the afternoon and evening which produced two tornadoes, very large hail and damaging winds.  A weak tornado formed 4 miles south of Lamont, Iowa in Buchanan County, tracked about 1 mile to the northeast before crossing into Delaware County. In Delaware County the tornado continued for about 13 miles to the northeast to Edgewood, Iowa.  Another weak tornado briefly touched down in Benton County, Iowa.

Temperatures warmed in the 80s with dew point readings in the upper 60s to mid 70s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with 3000 to 4000 J/kg of CAPE and downdraft CAPE of 1000 to 1500 J/kg.  The shear was strong with 50 to 60 kts available.  The freezing level was quite high, between 13,000 and 14,000 feet wtih CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere between 700 and 900 J/kg.  The precipitable water value was a between 1.5 and 1.8 inches.  The LCL was relatively low, around 1000 meters.  Thunderstorms moved into western Iowa out of Nebraska. As the afternoon and evening progressed, the thunderstorm complex evolved into one that was more outflow dominated.  The system raced southeast and produced high winds across the Des Moines metro area and to the east and south.  Winds of 60 to 80 MPH caused considerable tree and power line damage.  Power outages were reported by 27,000 customers in Des Moines at the height of the storm.

A street light was knocked down in Hastings near the intersection of 7th and Hewett streets.,"Although ground-truth reports of severe-criteria hail and wind emanated from only seven counties mainly within northern and central portions of South Central Nebraska on this Friday, the coverage of non-severe thunderstorms and locally heavy rain became rather widespread across much of the area during the late evening and lasting into the early morning hours of the 21st. Despite the somewhat limited areal coverage of verified severe storms, this was a more-significant-than-expected and fairly long-lasting event, as 25 severe thunderstorm warnings were issued in the local area over the course of eight hours between 230-1030 pm CDT, including for a storm that pounded parts of Grand Island with hail up to baseball size.    Several hours prior to the primary severe weather event, a lone morning storm dropped nickel size hail as it passed through Valley and Greeley counties. During the early stages of the main afternoon/evening development, generally between 230-500 pm CDT, transient clusters of strong to marginally severe multicell storms affected areas north of Highway 92, producing ping pong ball size hail near Cotesfield. The next few hours featured the storms of the day as a pair of very slow-moving supercells pounded the northern Hall and southern Howard county area. For the city of Grand Island, the first of these storms likely resulted in the most significant severe event of the 2014 convective season, as a swath extending from a few miles northwest of the city to near the downtown area was drilled with hail stones ranging from quarter to baseball size between mainly 6-7 pm CDT. During this same time frame, a separate, smaller severe storm in Sherman County dropped very large hail up to 3 in diameter in the Rockville area. As the initial Grand Island supercell started dissipating, a second supercell flared up just to its west over northwestern Hall County mainly between 730-830 pm CDT, pounding the Cairo area with hail up to golf ball size for several minutes. While this second supercell started to weaken, a considerable flare-up of strong to severe multicell convection commenced between 730-900 pm CDT within several northern and western counties such as Sherman, Dawson, Gosper and Furnas, resulting in a few reports of estimated 60-65 MPH winds. Generally between 9-11 pm CDT, much of this widespread convection rapidly congealed into a southeast-surging quasi-linear complex that took aim on the Tri-Cities area. During this time, measured wind gusts in Hall County included 58 MPH at the Grand Island airport and 76 MPH at a home weather station near Wood River. These damaging gusts then barreled into Adams County where Hastings airport measured a 67 MPH gust, resulting in the second round of tree damage and fairly minor structural damage within the city in less than one weeks time. Beyond 11 pm CDT, there were no further reports of severe storms within South Central Nebraska, although widespread redevelopment of convection continued through the night, especially near the Interstate 80 and Highway 6 corridors. By the end of the night, most of the 24-county area had tallied anywhere from 0.50 to 2 of rain. However, much higher pockets of at least 3-4 of rain targeted primarily northern Hall and southern Howard counties, northern Adams County and central/western Clay County. A few of the highest storm totals from a combination of automated gauges, NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers included 4.07 five miles west-southwest of Clay Center, 3.31 at Hastings airport and 3.11 three miles east-southeast of Dannebrog. Not surprisingly, short-term flooding issues materialized. While rain was still falling during the evening, water was reported over several county roads in southwestern Howard County, along with Highway 11 near Dannebrog. After daybreak on the 21st, reports arrived of several county roads in northwestern Adams County covered in water.     In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this was not really a synoptically-evident severe weather setup, thanks largely to the lack of a notable mid-upper level disturbance and also seasonably-weak deep layer wind shear. As a result, the severity/longevity of this event was largely underestimated in official forecasts, even within 12 hours of its onset. In the mid levels, fairly weak quasi-zonal flow containing very subtle disturbances was in place over Nebraska, well to the south of a compact-but-strong closed low churning over Saskatchewan and Manitoba. At the surface, only a few subtle boundaries were present within the region, but no well-defined fronts. However, as afternoon temperatures rose well into the upper 80s-low 90s F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s, significant instability developed in the form of mixed-layer CAPE soaring to between 3000-4000 J/kg. Despite 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear averaging no more than 20-30 knots, this highly unstable environment supported robust convection, including the few slow-moving supercells. After dark, the briefly-severe squall line and subsequent multi-hour period of regenerative non-severe storms was aided by the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet centered over western KS.",40.6,-98.43

539535,8/18/2014 1:07,58,MG,nan,"During a 3.5 hour period centered from 7-1030 pm CDT on this Sunday evening, a pair of strong to severe linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS) affected this six-county North Central Kansas area and merged with each other in the process. These storms were primarily damaging wind-producers. However, the one known severe-criteria hail report was a significant one as golf ball to softball size stones occurred near Agra. Wind-wise, the initial storm complex that moved into the area from northwest Kansas yielded severe-criteria measured gusts at Logan (58 MPH) and Phillipsburg airport (67 MPH). A bit later in the evening, following the merger of the first storm complex with a stronger, larger MCS diving southeastward out of south central Nebraska, Jewell and Mitchell counties bore the brunt of damaging winds including estimated 70 MPH winds in Mankato, a measured 86 MPH gust near Jewell, and a report of tree branches downed throughout Beloit. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection held amounts under 1 inch in most places.    Timing-wise, the first storm complex tracked into Phillips and Rooks counties from the west between 7-8 pm CDT, having grown upscale from its humble late-afternoon beginnings along western portions of the Kansas-Nebraska border. As this initial area of convection reached far eastern portions of Smith and Osborne counties around 930 pm CDT, its northern end quickly merged with the leading edges of a stronger linear MCS charging southeastward out of Nebraska. During the ensuing hour, strong to severe winds swept through Jewell and Mitchell counties before departing the local area to the east and southeast. Although showers/weak storms lingered over some places a bit longer, the vast majority of the local area was void of precipitation by 1230 am CDT on the 18th.   By late-summer standards, this synoptic and mesoscale setup was fairly ripe for an organized severe weather event. In the mid-upper levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough brushed into the Central Plains from the northwest, along the southern periphery of a larger scale disturbance centered over southern Saskatchewan/Manitoba. As a result, mid-upper level flow increased enough to promote generally 30-35 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear over North Central Kansas. In addition, instability was quite potent as the combination of afternoon surface temperatures in the 90s F and dewpoints in the 60s promoted mixed-layer CAPE values of 2000-4000 J/kg ahead of the incoming convective complexes.",39.73,-99.32

524769,6/15/2014 4:53,60,MG,A tree fell on and damaged a home on the west side of Hastings.,"During a month that had several rounds of severe weather in South Central Nebraska, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east through most locations near and south of Interstate 80 during the later evening. Earlier in the event, more discrete convection resulted primarily in numerous reports of severe-criteria hail, some as large as tennis ball to grapefruit size, along with four confirmed, brief EF0 tornadoes that yielded no reports of damage. The first of these tornadoes occurred in northwestern Franklin County near Hildreth around 730 pm CDT. The other three tornadoes were associated with a supercell storm that drifted northeast out of Kansas along a path from Webster to Hamilton counties before being absorbed into a larger line of convection. The first of these tornadoes was sighted in far southwestern Webster County around 830 pm CDT while the final two brief touchdowns occurred after nightfall in southwestern Hamilton County between Trumbull and Giltner between 1000-1030 pm CDT. In terms of hail, the largest confirmed stone of 4.25 fell three miles southeast of Hastings around 930 pm CDT. Other notable hail reports included stones up to baseball size along the Nance-Merrick County line, in and near Gibbon, near Ayr and in Arapahoe. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across roughly the southern half of the 24-county area later in the evening ended up being the big story of this event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through essentially all areas between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 82 MPH by a storm chaser near the Interstate 80 York exit, 79 MPH at Hastings airport, and 76 MPH at home weather stations near Davenport and Ohiowa. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and also damaged several structures, including outbuildings, grain bins and power poles. To cite just a few examples of this damage as it progressed from west to east: at Harlan County Lake at least four small boats were rammed into the shore and a camping trailer was overturned onto a vehicle, in Guide Rock a garage was blown off its foundation and partially onto a roadway, and at the Nuckolls County fairgrounds in Nelson a tin roof was removed from a barn, the roof of the arena was damaged and a camper was flipped on its side. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most storms, rainfall totals across much of South Central Nebraska did not exceed 1-2 inches. However, a southwest-to-northeast corridor of 2-3 and locally higher rainfall centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Wilcox-Grand Island-Genoa, featuring NeRAIN observer totals of 4.13 three miles west-southwest of Genoa and 4.06 two miles of Doniphan.  Breaking down event timing, the initial round of at least semi-discrete convection, including a few supercells, flared up between 530-730 pm CDT within a fairly narrow southwest-to-northeast oriented corridor along a slow-moving but well-defined cold front. Most of this early convection concentrated several miles either side of a line from near Franklin and Red Cloud in the south, then north-northeast through the Hastings-Grand Island-Central City-Fullerton areas. Generally between 730-930 pm CDT, this initially narrow corridor of storms gradually expanded in coverage to both the west and east. Then, even as ongoing convection remained strong to severe, the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of southwest Nebraska, entering southwestern portions of the local area between 930-1030 pm CDT. For the next few hours generally between 1030 pm to 1 am CDT, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of roughly the southern half of South Central Nebraska, while the far northern end of the line gradually merged with the earlier convection that had largely lifted north of Interstate 80 by this time and had weakened somewhat. Finally, between 1-2 am CDT, the line of severe storms cleared the far eastern edges of the local area near the Highway 81 corridor, leaving behind only a trailing zone of stratiform rain that lingered into the pre-dawn hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska by early evening. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the upper-80s to lower-90s F while dewpoints generally held in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/expanded the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.6,-98.43

519917,6/4/2014 1:08,61,MG,"A thunderstorm outflow boundary surged through the Hastings area, several miles to the south of any actual precipitation associated with parent thunderstorms.","For roughly the northeast half of this 24-county South Central Nebraska area, this late Tuesday afternoon and evening featured one of the most widespread severe weather events of the 2014 convective season. In essence, three separate waves of primarily outflow-dominant convection rolled across the area along a west-northwest to east-southeast path over the course of several hours, resulting in dozens of reports of large hail and damaging winds, along with three fairly brief tornadoes, two rated EF0 and one EF1. There was a notably sharp cutoff in severe thunderstorm activity within South Central Nebraska, as nearly all storms concentrated northeast of a line from roughly Litchfield-Hastings-Geneva, while most locations southwest of this line did not even observe a single raindrop. Starting with the three tornadoes, the first two were brief, EF0 touchdowns that occurred in far northern Valley and north central Greeley counties during the 415-515 pm CDT time frame, and were associated with the first supercell storm of the event that tracked into the local area from the west-northwest. These tornadoes produced little if any direct damage. The third confirmed tornado of the event was a bit more significant, and occurred several hours later after dark, around 1030 pm CDT in eastern Hamilton County north of Hampton. This EF1 tornado struck two homes, blowing a portion of the roof off of one of them. As for large hail, there were several reports of stones up to around golf ball size in places such as Spalding, Osceola, Arcadia, York, McCool Junction and Exeter. Many places were hit with more than one round of hail, including York, where golf ball size hail first fell around 830 pm CDT and then again around 11 pm CDT. In many cases, hail was accompanied by severe outflow winds of generally 60-80 MPH, resulting in broken windows and siding damage to several structures, along with tree damage. As just a few specific examples of wind reports and damage: Ord airport measured a 79 MPH gust, a rural residence four miles northeast of Scotia sustained considerable damage to outbuildings along with broken house windows, and a grocery store in Wolbach had its roof peeled back. In addition to damaging winds directly associated with severe storms, places farther south near the Highway 6 corridor, including Hastings, observed the passage of a notably strong, southward-surging outflow boundary around 8 pm CDT that produced measured 70+ MPH winds and significant blowing dust. At the time this outflow plowed through Hastings, the nearest precipitation associated with actual thunderstorms was at least 15-20 miles off to the north-northeast. As for event-total rainfall, most of the affected areas tallied somewhere between 1-3, although localized higher amounts occurred mainly in Nance and Polk counties, including NeRAIN observer totals of 3.70 two miles west-northwest of Shelby and 3.68 seven miles north of Osceola.   Taking a closer look at severe weather timing, the morning actually started out with a cluster of strong storms that rumbled through many of the same northern counties that would later see the main event. These early-day storms produced nickel size hail in Arcadia, but by 930 am CDT all morning activity had exited South Central Nebraska, kicking off a multi-hour lull. Then, generally between 430-630 pm CDT, round 1 of severe storms, anchored by an outflow-dominant supercell that produced the EF0 tornadoes, raked across mainly the far northern and northeastern fringes of the local area before exiting into eastern Nebraska. Around the time round 1 was exiting stage right, round 2 of severe storms entered Valley and Greeley counties from the northwest between 6-7 pm CDT and tracked east-southeast for the next few hours before exiting the eastern York County area around 9 pm CDT. Following a very similar theme, round 3 of severe storms initially intensified over the Valley/Sherman counties area between 830-930 pm CDT, and proceeded to pass east-southeast over many of the same areas as the previous round. However this final cluster of fairly fast-moving severe storms slipped a touch farther southeast, affecting more of the Fillmore County area before exiting into eastern Nebraska around 1230 am CDT on the 4th. Although a few non-severe storms lingered a bit later near the Interstate 80 corridor, essentially all of South Central Nebraska was finally storm-free by 230 am CDT.  On the mid-upper level synoptic scale, the main trigger for this event was an energetic, although fairly-low amplitude shortwave trough that raced out of the Intermountain West and into the Central Plains. A corresponding westerly mid-level speed max of around 60-70 knots at 500 millibars accompanied this wave, which combined with steepening mid level lapse rates and surface dewpoints generally in the low-mid 60s F to yield a fairly volatile late afternoon/early evening mesoscale environment featuring around 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and a notable 60-70 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear. Low level shear and storm-relative helicity also became quite pronounced in the vicinity of a fairly sharp surface warm front that became quasi-stationary through much of the day and evening along an axis through northwest-central-southeast Nebraska. Despite the considerable severe weather that occurred, there were indications leading up to the event that it could have been worse. For one thing, the mesoscale environment was initially supportive of more destructive, longer-track tornadoes, but this threat steadily diminished as most storms quickly became outflow-dominant and generated a larger-scale cold pool. Secondly, the areal coverage of severe storms was not as widespread as it could have been, as a mid level capping inversion south of the strong warm front spared most of the southwest half of the local area from observing any convection. At any rate, this severe weather event was well-anticipated at least a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.6,-98.43

525204,6/15/2014 4:44,62,MG,This gust was on the trailing edge of the primarily squall line that had moved east.,"During a month with several rounds of severe weather in this six-county portion of North Central Kansas, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east across the area in the form of an intense forward-propagating squall line. A few hours prior to these severe winds entering the local area, an isolated supercell storm cluster drifted slowly northeast across parts of Rooks, Phillips and Smith counties before departing into Nebraska, producing one highly-visible, short-track landspout tornado and a few reports of quarter to golf ball size hail. The EF1-rated tornado, which touched down around 530 pm CDT near Webster State Park shortly after storms first initiated, damaged power poles and fencing along its brief path. In terms of hail, the largest reported golf ball size stones fell in the Glade area shortly after the dissipation of the Rooks County tornado. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across the six-county area later in the evening was truly the main event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through nearly every square mile of North Central Kansas. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 86 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport and 77 MPH at a home weather station near Webber. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and likely also damaged several structures. Based on a limited number of damage reports that were received, one of the more newsworthy incidents involved several campers blown over at Webster State Park, along with a roof blown off a cabin. Due to the progressive nature of these storms, rainfall totals across most of North Central Kansas averaged less than 1.   Breaking down event timing, the initial supercell cluster that produced the landspout tornado in northern Rooks County flared up between 5-6 pm CDT near the leading edge of the invading cold front. As this storm cluster slowly drifted northeast through Smith County, it evolved into a more compact-but-organized discrete supercell that exited northward into Nebraska around 830 pm CDT. This storms departure ushered in a nearly two-hour lull in local thunderstorm activity, before the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of northwest Kansas into Phillips and Rooks counties between 10-11 pm CDT. For the next few hours, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of the six-county area before gradually departing the eastern edges of Jewell and Mitchell counties between 12-1 am CDT, leaving behind only a trailing area of stratiform rain that lingered for a few more hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged southeastward into North Central Kansas during the evening, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the low-mid 90s F while dewpoints generally averaged in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed much of North Central Kansas in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",39.75,-98.78
525251,6/15/2014 5:38,62,MG,This wind gust of 71 MPH was measured by a mobile wind instrument. Power flashes were also observed.,"During a month that had several rounds of severe weather in South Central Nebraska, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east through most locations near and south of Interstate 80 during the later evening. Earlier in the event, more discrete convection resulted primarily in numerous reports of severe-criteria hail, some as large as tennis ball to grapefruit size, along with four confirmed, brief EF0 tornadoes that yielded no reports of damage. The first of these tornadoes occurred in northwestern Franklin County near Hildreth around 730 pm CDT. The other three tornadoes were associated with a supercell storm that drifted northeast out of Kansas along a path from Webster to Hamilton counties before being absorbed into a larger line of convection. The first of these tornadoes was sighted in far southwestern Webster County around 830 pm CDT while the final two brief touchdowns occurred after nightfall in southwestern Hamilton County between Trumbull and Giltner between 1000-1030 pm CDT. In terms of hail, the largest confirmed stone of 4.25 fell three miles southeast of Hastings around 930 pm CDT. Other notable hail reports included stones up to baseball size along the Nance-Merrick County line, in and near Gibbon, near Ayr and in Arapahoe. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across roughly the southern half of the 24-county area later in the evening ended up being the big story of this event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through essentially all areas between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 82 MPH by a storm chaser near the Interstate 80 York exit, 79 MPH at Hastings airport, and 76 MPH at home weather stations near Davenport and Ohiowa. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and also damaged several structures, including outbuildings, grain bins and power poles. To cite just a few examples of this damage as it progressed from west to east: at Harlan County Lake at least four small boats were rammed into the shore and a camping trailer was overturned onto a vehicle, in Guide Rock a garage was blown off its foundation and partially onto a roadway, and at the Nuckolls County fairgrounds in Nelson a tin roof was removed from a barn, the roof of the arena was damaged and a camper was flipped on its side. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most storms, rainfall totals across much of South Central Nebraska did not exceed 1-2 inches. However, a southwest-to-northeast corridor of 2-3 and locally higher rainfall centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Wilcox-Grand Island-Genoa, featuring NeRAIN observer totals of 4.13 three miles west-southwest of Genoa and 4.06 two miles of Doniphan.  Breaking down event timing, the initial round of at least semi-discrete convection, including a few supercells, flared up between 530-730 pm CDT within a fairly narrow southwest-to-northeast oriented corridor along a slow-moving but well-defined cold front. Most of this early convection concentrated several miles either side of a line from near Franklin and Red Cloud in the south, then north-northeast through the Hastings-Grand Island-Central City-Fullerton areas. Generally between 730-930 pm CDT, this initially narrow corridor of storms gradually expanded in coverage to both the west and east. Then, even as ongoing convection remained strong to severe, the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of southwest Nebraska, entering southwestern portions of the local area between 930-1030 pm CDT. For the next few hours generally between 1030 pm to 1 am CDT, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of roughly the southern half of South Central Nebraska, while the far northern end of the line gradually merged with the earlier convection that had largely lifted north of Interstate 80 by this time and had weakened somewhat. Finally, between 1-2 am CDT, the line of severe storms cleared the far eastern edges of the local area near the Highway 81 corridor, leaving behind only a trailing zone of stratiform rain that lingered into the pre-dawn hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska by early evening. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the upper-80s to lower-90s F while dewpoints generally held in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/expanded the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.659,-97.57

An extremely unstable air mass was over the area on June 16 along with strong deep layer shear.  This allowed scattered supercells to form during the afternoon and evening which produced two tornadoes, very large hail and damaging winds.  A weak tornado formed 4 miles south of Lamont, Iowa in Buchanan County, tracked about 1 mile to the northeast before crossing into Delaware County. In Delaware County the tornado continued for about 13 miles to the northeast to Edgewood, Iowa.  Another weak tornado briefly touched down in Benton County, Iowa. Strengthening mid level winds along with a strong low level jet in place later in the evening and overnight on June 17 produced widespread damaging winds of 60 to 70 mph.

530464,6/21/2014 3:01,62,MG,A thunderstorm wind gust was measured at 71 mph. This gust occurred from outflow well south of the associated thunderstorm.,"Although ground-truth reports of severe-criteria hail and wind emanated from only seven counties mainly within northern and central portions of South Central Nebraska on this Friday, the coverage of non-severe thunderstorms and locally heavy rain became rather widespread across much of the area during the late evening and lasting into the early morning hours of the 21st. Despite the somewhat limited areal coverage of verified severe storms, this was a more-significant-than-expected and fairly long-lasting event, as 25 severe thunderstorm warnings were issued in the local area over the course of eight hours between 230-1030 pm CDT, including for a storm that pounded parts of Grand Island with hail up to baseball size.    Several hours prior to the primary severe weather event, a lone morning storm dropped nickel size hail as it passed through Valley and Greeley counties. During the early stages of the main afternoon/evening development, generally between 230-500 pm CDT, transient clusters of strong to marginally severe multicell storms affected areas north of Highway 92, producing ping pong ball size hail near Cotesfield. The next few hours featured the storms of the day as a pair of very slow-moving supercells pounded the northern Hall and southern Howard county area. For the city of Grand Island, the first of these storms likely resulted in the most significant severe event of the 2014 convective season, as a swath extending from a few miles northwest of the city to near the downtown area was drilled with hail stones ranging from quarter to baseball size between mainly 6-7 pm CDT. During this same time frame, a separate, smaller severe storm in Sherman County dropped very large hail up to 3 in diameter in the Rockville area. As the initial Grand Island supercell started dissipating, a second supercell flared up just to its west over northwestern Hall County mainly between 730-830 pm CDT, pounding the Cairo area with hail up to golf ball size for several minutes. While this second supercell started to weaken, a considerable flare-up of strong to severe multicell convection commenced between 730-900 pm CDT within several northern and western counties such as Sherman, Dawson, Gosper and Furnas, resulting in a few reports of estimated 60-65 MPH winds. Generally between 9-11 pm CDT, much of this widespread convection rapidly congealed into a southeast-surging quasi-linear complex that took aim on the Tri-Cities area. During this time, measured wind gusts in Hall County included 58 MPH at the Grand Island airport and 76 MPH at a home weather station near Wood River. These damaging gusts then barreled into Adams County where Hastings airport measured a 67 MPH gust, resulting in the second round of tree damage and fairly minor structural damage within the city in less than one weeks time. Beyond 11 pm CDT, there were no further reports of severe storms within South Central Nebraska, although widespread redevelopment of convection continued through the night, especially near the Interstate 80 and Highway 6 corridors. By the end of the night, most of the 24-county area had tallied anywhere from 0.50 to 2 of rain. However, much higher pockets of at least 3-4 of rain targeted primarily northern Hall and southern Howard counties, northern Adams County and central/western Clay County. A few of the highest storm totals from a combination of automated gauges, NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers included 4.07 five miles west-southwest of Clay Center, 3.31 at Hastings airport and 3.11 three miles east-southeast of Dannebrog. Not surprisingly, short-term flooding issues materialized. While rain was still falling during the evening, water was reported over several county roads in southwestern Howard County, along with Highway 11 near Dannebrog. After daybreak on the 21st, reports arrived of several county roads in northwestern Adams County covered in water.     In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this was not really a synoptically-evident severe weather setup, thanks largely to the lack of a notable mid-upper level disturbance and also seasonably-weak deep layer wind shear. As a result, the severity/longevity of this event was largely underestimated in official forecasts, even within 12 hours of its onset. In the mid levels, fairly weak quasi-zonal flow containing very subtle disturbances was in place over Nebraska, well to the south of a compact-but-strong closed low churning over Saskatchewan and Manitoba. At the surface, only a few subtle boundaries were present within the region, but no well-defined fronts. However, as afternoon temperatures rose well into the upper 80s-low 90s F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s, significant instability developed in the form of mixed-layer CAPE soaring to between 3000-4000 J/kg. Despite 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear averaging no more than 20-30 knots, this highly unstable environment supported robust convection, including the few slow-moving supercells. After dark, the briefly-severe squall line and subsequent multi-hour period of regenerative non-severe storms was aided by the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet centered over western KS.",40.67,-98.57

539623,8/10/2014 3:31,62,MG,"Tree limbs, including a few large ones, were downed in town.","For the second consecutive night, widespread thunderstorm activity blossomed across most all of the 24-county South Central Nebraska area on this Saturday, although just like the previous night all severe-criteria hail and wind reports emanated from counties along and west of the Highway 281 corridor. Early in the evening, an isolated severe storm dropped torrential rainfall and hail up to golf ball size over central Franklin County. Thereafter, the majority of severe weather later in the evening was associated with a pair of southeastward-surging storm clusters. The western-most one peaked in intensity over Dawson and western Buffalo counties, highlighted by reports of quarter to golf ball size hail in the Elm Creek area and golf ball to baseball size hail in the Lexington area. A bit farther east and a bit later, a separate severe storm cluster was more of a damaging wind producer as it raced through southern Hall and Adams counties and portions of neighboring counties. In these areas, estimated 60 MPH winds were reported in the Ayr and Bladen areas, and more significant peak gusts of slightly over 70 MPH were measured near Wood River and at Hastings airport, resulting in reports of a few large tree limbs down in the city. Fortunately for the majority of South Central Nebraska, most storms on this night produced only sub-severe wind gusts and non-flooding rainfall mainly under 1.50 inches. Localized pockets of the area measured higher rainfall amounts, but none more so than a small zone of very heavy rain up to around 6 that fell in east-central Franklin County, most of which from the aforementioned, slow-moving early evening storm.   Breaking down the timing of thunderstorm evolution in more detail, its worth noting that well-before the onset of the evening main event several strong thunderstorms rumbled across the far northern/northeastern fringes of the local area for much of the day. Although radar suggested a few of these daytime storms may have produced larger hail (especially in northern Valley/Greeley counties), limited ground-truth reports yielded no larger than dime size stones. The primary evening event got underway between 630-730 pm CDT as a slow-moving, isolated severe storm blew up over Franklin County before eventually departing southeastward into northern Kansas. As the Franklin County storm was in progress, a southeastward-surging supercell cluster entered the local area from Custer County between 730-830 pm CDT, primarily impacting Dawson County and vicinity. Over the next few hours, this initial severe storm cluster weakened while a plethora of additional multicell and linear thunderstorm complexes blossomed over the majority of South Central Nebraska. While much of this activity was sub-severe, a second southeast-surging storm complex produced the damaging winds in the Hall/Adams counties area between 10-11 pm CDT. After 11 pm CDT, all storms in South Central Nebraska exhibited a steady weakening trend although widespread showers and embedded thunderstorms lingered well past midnight in many areas.   This was a fairly typical late-summer severe weather event featuring fairly high instability values but only modest deep layer wind shear and weak large scale forcing. In the mid to upper levels, generally quasi-zonal flow was in place over the Central Plains, containing one or more fairly subtle shortwave troughs. At the surface, storms during the main evening event initiated in the vicinity of a northwest-southeast oriented quasi stationary front draped from western Nebraska into north central Kansas, with this front partially composed of a remnant outflow boundary from the previous nights convection. With surface dewpoints well into the mid-60s to low-70s F across the local area, most-unstable CAPE climbed as high as 2000-3000 J/kg. Although a few storms briefly exhibited supercell structures, 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear only averaging around 30 knots promoted a predominant multicell/quasi-linear mode.",40.6,-98.43
539547,8/18/2014 1:22,62,MG,nan,"During a four-hour period centered from 630-1030 pm CDT on this Sunday evening, a complex of severe thunderstorms tracked from northwest-to-southeast through primarily the southwestern two-thirds of South Central Nebraska, resulting in numerous reports of damaging winds ranging from 60 to around 80 MPH. Hail was not a significant issue, with nickel size stones being the largest reported. Although high winds also affected some counties farther west, the primary swath of damaging winds was roughly 20-40 miles wide, extending from the Valley/Sherman counties area in the northwest, southeastward through the Hall/Adams/Nuckolls counties areas. Along this main corridor, a sampling of the most wind significant reports in chronological order included: estimated 70 MPH winds in the Elyria and Litchfield areas with crop and tree damage, a measured 71 MPH gust near Wood River, a measured peak gust of 83 MPH at Hastings airport along with 10-20 minutes of persistent 60-80 MPH wind behind the initial surge, and up to 30 minutes of estimated 60-70 MPH gusts in Superior. Off to the west of this main zone of wind issues, there were a few reports of gusts around 60 MPH in the Lexington and Arapahoe areas. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection kept totals in most places no higher than 0.50-1.50 inches, with a few of the wetter exceptions per NeRAIN observes featuring 2.30 nine miles northwest of Ord and 2.13 six miles southeast of Davenport.   In a basic sense, this event consisted of an initially semi-discrete supercell cluster that first developed in north central Nebraska during the mid-afternoon hours and then gradually grew upscale into a larger-scale, forward-propagating linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) as it crossed the local South Central Nebraska area. This intense storm complex first infiltrated the local area into Valley/Sherman/Dawson counties between 630-730 pm CDT, blew through the Grand Island/Hastings areas during the 815-930 pm CDT time frame and finally departed southeastward into northern Kansas between 10-11 pm CDT. Although showers/weak storms lingered over mainly eastern counties a bit longer, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska was void of precipitation by 1 am CDT on the 18th.   By late-summer standards, this synoptic and mesoscale setup was fairly ripe for an organized severe weather event. In the mid-upper levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough brushed into Nebraska from the northwest, along the southern periphery of a larger scale disturbance centered over southern Saskatchewan/Manitoba. As a result, mid-upper level flow increased enough to promote generally 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear over South Central Nebraska. In addition, instability was quite potent as the combination of afternoon surface temperatures in the upper-80s/near 90 F and dewpoints in the mid-60s/low-70s promoted mixed-layer CAPE values of 2000-4000 J/kg ahead of the incoming convective complex.",40.8055,-98.6

Scattered thunderstorms were ongoing over northwestern Kansas earlier in the evening, with a gradual progression eastward. Around 9 p.m. CDT, new thunderstorms developed over Norton County and quickly expanded eastward into Phillips County, forming a narrow east-west oriented line. This line began propagating southeastward and took on the form of a cluster, mainly affecting Rooks and Osborne counties. Winds were measured at 71 MPH at the airport near Stockton and a trained spotter estimated 60-70 MPH winds near Natoma, with numerous downed tree branches. The size of the branches was unknown.  These storms formed between an east-west oriented stationary front across central Kansas and an approaching cold front over Nebraska.  The flow aloft was weak and fairly zonal. A shortwave trough was moving across the Northern and Central Plains, with a 45-50 knot speed max at 250 mb. Prior to the thunderstorms moving in, temperatures were in the 80s, with dewpoints in the upper 60s. The surface environment, overlain with very steep mid-level lapse rates of 8-8.5 degrees C/km, resulted in strong instability. MLCAPE was nearly 4000 J/kg.

Precipitable water increased to around 1.75 inches. The freezing level was quite high at around 15,000 feet. Fairly strong shear was present with 40 to 50 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  These parameters led to an unusual event across Iowa with numerous relatively short track tornadoes along with several reports of straight line wind damage.    The event started when a line of thunderstorms formed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa then moved east across the state through the evening hours. Hail with the storms was generally quite small. One inch diameter hail fell in Crawford County in Dow City.  However, high winds were much more common as the MCS progressed across the state. Several locations reported gusts of 60 MPH or higher. An 80 MPH gust was reported in Guthrie County at Yale and Bayard. A 71 MPH wind gust occurred in Marion County. Heavy rainfall was also of significance with flash flooding in Crawford County. This was caused by a dam failure which flooded Highway 39. Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes in Dallas County. There were numerous reports of around 2 inches of rain falling in Boone and Polk Counties. Water ponding and low-land flooding was common. One person was struck by lightning at the Denison Airport.

510533,5/11/2014 20:47,63,MG,nan,"Multiple thunderstorms formed along and southeast of a line from Red Cloud to York on this Sunday afternoon. However, most of the severe weather was produced by a single supercell. This was the first and most intense storm of the day and it formed over Webster county around 2:30 p.m. CDT. This storm took full advantage of an extremely favorable environment, quickly becoming severe and producing at least one brief, weak tornado just southwest of Glenvil. The storm continued northeast producing several more tornadoes, two of which resulted in a maximum damage rating of EF-3. One of these tornadoes occurred over Clay and Fillmore counties and the other subsequently occurred over Fillmore and Seward counties. The first of these EF-3 tornadoes was on the ground for nearly 22 miles. Damage surveys, photos and video confirmed that this storm produced at least 6 other tornadoes, 3 rated EF-0, 2 rated EF-1 and 1 rated EF-2. One of the EF-1 tornadoes was anticyclonic and touched down just north of Fairmont. To the left of these tornadoes, severe hail was common. The largest hail observed was the size of tennis balls in Glenvil. Large swaths of damaging winds, from the rear flank downdraft, accompanied the tornadoes to their south and southeast. Tornado and wind damage was extensive to trees, power poles, farm buildings including grain bins, and a few homes. Over 200 irrigation pivots were overturned and/or twisted. Multiple farmsteads also endured damage, including the loss of a new  machine shed. By 5:30 p.m., this storm had moved into eastern Nebraska. Other storms developed in its wake, but produced no severe weather.   A very long surface front extended from New England, through the Ohio Valley, across the Central Plains and into the Desert Southwest. Portions of this front were stationary while others were being modulated by several waves of low pressure. The front lifted northward to the Kansas-Nebraska border by daybreak. One low ejected out of Colorado and moved east along the front through northern Kansas during the day. This supercell formed just northeast of this low on the immediate cool side of the front. The upper-level flow featured an amplified western trough and eastern ridge. A closed low was at the base of the trough over the Four Corners region. These storms initiated with the aid of a shortwave trough that ejected into the Central Plains ahead of this low. A strong 100 knot jet streak was at the base of the trough at 300 mb, placing the Central Plains in the favorable left front quadrant. An expansive stratus cloud deck, on the cool side of the front, resulted in a substantial temperature gradient across the front, with afternoon temperatures in the 40s and 50s across much of Nebraska to the mid 80s and low 90s over northern Kansas. This resulted in a tight instability gradient with MLCAPE of 2000 J/kg right along the front. Winds were strong throughout the column. The ejecting low pressure center, combined with the front, resulted in significantly backed winds, enhancing low-level shear. 0-1 km SRH was roughly 300 m2/s2, with 0-3 km SRH 400-600 m2/s2.

519915,6/4/2014 1:01,63,MG,"An intense outflow boundary moved south through the Hastings area, with this gust measured at the NWS office north of town. These gusts were several miles removed from actual thunderstorms off to the north-northeast.","For roughly the northeast half of this 24-county South Central Nebraska area, this late Tuesday afternoon and evening featured one of the most widespread severe weather events of the 2014 convective season. In essence, three separate waves of primarily outflow-dominant convection rolled across the area along a west-northwest to east-southeast path over the course of several hours, resulting in dozens of reports of large hail and damaging winds, along with three fairly brief tornadoes, two rated EF0 and one EF1. There was a notably sharp cutoff in severe thunderstorm activity within South Central Nebraska, as nearly all storms concentrated northeast of a line from roughly Litchfield-Hastings-Geneva, while most locations southwest of this line did not even observe a single raindrop. Starting with the three tornadoes, the first two were brief, EF0 touchdowns that occurred in far northern Valley and north central Greeley counties during the 415-515 pm CDT time frame, and were associated with the first supercell storm of the event that tracked into the local area from the west-northwest. These tornadoes produced little if any direct damage. The third confirmed tornado of the event was a bit more significant, and occurred several hours later after dark, around 1030 pm CDT in eastern Hamilton County north of Hampton. This EF1 tornado struck two homes, blowing a portion of the roof off of one of them. As for large hail, there were several reports of stones up to around golf ball size in places such as Spalding, Osceola, Arcadia, York, McCool Junction and Exeter. Many places were hit with more than one round of hail, including York, where golf ball size hail first fell around 830 pm CDT and then again around 11 pm CDT. In many cases, hail was accompanied by severe outflow winds of generally 60-80 MPH, resulting in broken windows and siding damage to several structures, along with tree damage. As just a few specific examples of wind reports and damage: Ord airport measured a 79 MPH gust, a rural residence four miles northeast of Scotia sustained considerable damage to outbuildings along with broken house windows, and a grocery store in Wolbach had its roof peeled back. In addition to damaging winds directly associated with severe storms, places farther south near the Highway 6 corridor, including Hastings, observed the passage of a notably strong, southward-surging outflow boundary around 8 pm CDT that produced measured 70+ MPH winds and significant blowing dust. At the time this outflow plowed through Hastings, the nearest precipitation associated with actual thunderstorms was at least 15-20 miles off to the north-northeast. As for event-total rainfall, most of the affected areas tallied somewhere between 1-3, although localized higher amounts occurred mainly in Nance and Polk counties, including NeRAIN observer totals of 3.70 two miles west-northwest of Shelby and 3.68 seven miles north of Osceola.   Taking a closer look at severe weather timing, the morning actually started out with a cluster of strong storms that rumbled through many of the same northern counties that would later see the main event. These early-day storms produced nickel size hail in Arcadia, but by 930 am CDT all morning activity had exited South Central Nebraska, kicking off a multi-hour lull. Then, generally between 430-630 pm CDT, round 1 of severe storms, anchored by an outflow-dominant supercell that produced the EF0 tornadoes, raked across mainly the far northern and northeastern fringes of the local area before exiting into eastern Nebraska. Around the time round 1 was exiting stage right, round 2 of severe storms entered Valley and Greeley counties from the northwest between 6-7 pm CDT and tracked east-southeast for the next few hours before exiting the eastern York County area around 9 pm CDT. Following a very similar theme, round 3 of severe storms initially intensified over the Valley/Sherman counties area between 830-930 pm CDT, and proceeded to pass east-southeast over many of the same areas as the previous round. However this final cluster of fairly fast-moving severe storms slipped a touch farther southeast, affecting more of the Fillmore County area before exiting into eastern Nebraska around 1230 am CDT on the 4th. Although a few non-severe storms lingered a bit later near the Interstate 80 corridor, essentially all of South Central Nebraska was finally storm-free by 230 am CDT.  On the mid-upper level synoptic scale, the main trigger for this event was an energetic, although fairly-low amplitude shortwave trough that raced out of the Intermountain West and into the Central Plains. A corresponding westerly mid-level speed max of around 60-70 knots at 500 millibars accompanied this wave, which combined with steepening mid level lapse rates and surface dewpoints generally in the low-mid 60s F to yield a fairly volatile late afternoon/early evening mesoscale environment featuring around 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and a notable 60-70 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear. Low level shear and storm-relative helicity also became quite pronounced in the vicinity of a fairly sharp surface warm front that became quasi-stationary through much of the day and evening along an axis through northwest-central-southeast Nebraska. Despite the considerable severe weather that occurred, there were indications leading up to the event that it could have been worse. For one thing, the mesoscale environment was initially supportive of more destructive, longer-track tornadoes, but this threat steadily diminished as most storms quickly became outflow-dominant and generated a larger-scale cold pool. Secondly, the areal coverage of severe storms was not as widespread as it could have been, as a mid level capping inversion south of the strong warm front spared most of the southwest half of the local area from observing any convection. At any rate, this severe weather event was well-anticipated at least a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.65,-98.39

No other severe weather was reported with this line, which rapidly weakened as it continued south into Mitchell county.   These storms formed just behind a weak cold front that was dropping south through the region. In the upper levels, subtropical high pressure was sprawled over the southern United States with a ridge over the Rockies and a trough over the Northern Plains and Great Lakes. Just before the storms moved in, temperatures were in the upper 70s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. MUCAPE was between 1000 and 2000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 25-30 knots.

539620,8/10/2014 3:14,63,MG,nan,"For the second consecutive night, widespread thunderstorm activity blossomed across most all of the 24-county South Central Nebraska area on this Saturday, although just like the previous night all severe-criteria hail and wind reports emanated from counties along and west of the Highway 281 corridor. Early in the evening, an isolated severe storm dropped torrential rainfall and hail up to golf ball size over central Franklin County. Thereafter, the majority of severe weather later in the evening was associated with a pair of southeastward-surging storm clusters. The western-most one peaked in intensity over Dawson and western Buffalo counties, highlighted by reports of quarter to golf ball size hail in the Elm Creek area and golf ball to baseball size hail in the Lexington area. A bit farther east and a bit later, a separate severe storm cluster was more of a damaging wind producer as it raced through southern Hall and Adams counties and portions of neighboring counties. In these areas, estimated 60 MPH winds were reported in the Ayr and Bladen areas, and more significant peak gusts of slightly over 70 MPH were measured near Wood River and at Hastings airport, resulting in reports of a few large tree limbs down in the city. Fortunately for the majority of South Central Nebraska, most storms on this night produced only sub-severe wind gusts and non-flooding rainfall mainly under 1.50 inches. Localized pockets of the area measured higher rainfall amounts, but none more so than a small zone of very heavy rain up to around 6 that fell in east-central Franklin County, most of which from the aforementioned, slow-moving early evening storm.   Breaking down the timing of thunderstorm evolution in more detail, its worth noting that well-before the onset of the evening main event several strong thunderstorms rumbled across the far northern/northeastern fringes of the local area for much of the day. Although radar suggested a few of these daytime storms may have produced larger hail (especially in northern Valley/Greeley counties), limited ground-truth reports yielded no larger than dime size stones. The primary evening event got underway between 630-730 pm CDT as a slow-moving, isolated severe storm blew up over Franklin County before eventually departing southeastward into northern Kansas. As the Franklin County storm was in progress, a southeastward-surging supercell cluster entered the local area from Custer County between 730-830 pm CDT, primarily impacting Dawson County and vicinity. Over the next few hours, this initial severe storm cluster weakened while a plethora of additional multicell and linear thunderstorm complexes blossomed over the majority of South Central Nebraska. While much of this activity was sub-severe, a second southeast-surging storm complex produced the damaging winds in the Hall/Adams counties area between 10-11 pm CDT. After 11 pm CDT, all storms in South Central Nebraska exhibited a steady weakening trend although widespread showers and embedded thunderstorms lingered well past midnight in many areas.   This was a fairly typical late-summer severe weather event featuring fairly high instability values but only modest deep layer wind shear and weak large scale forcing. In the mid to upper levels, generally quasi-zonal flow was in place over the Central Plains, containing one or more fairly subtle shortwave troughs. At the surface, storms during the main evening event initiated in the vicinity of a northwest-southeast oriented quasi stationary front draped from western Nebraska into north central Kansas, with this front partially composed of a remnant outflow boundary from the previous nights convection. With surface dewpoints well into the mid-60s to low-70s F across the local area, most-unstable CAPE climbed as high as 2000-3000 J/kg. Although a few storms briefly exhibited supercell structures, 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear only averaging around 30 knots promoted a predominant multicell/quasi-linear mode.",40.8055,-98.6

545884,10/2/2014 11:40,63,MG,CoCoRaHS observer reported measured 73 MPH gust along with pea to dime size hail.,"Shortly before sunrise on this Thursday morning this six-county North Central Kansas area endured its final severe thunderstorm of 2014, and considering the time of day, the semi-discrete storms surprising furiosity made for a noteworthy event. In a mesoscale environment that appeared mainly supportive of non-severe elevated convection, this intense storm gradually became more surface-based as it first crossed southern Osborne County between 515-610 am CDT and then tore across the heart of Mitchell County from 610-700 am CDT before exiting the local area. While no verifying ground-truth severe weather reports were received from within Osborne and western Mitchell counties, that changed over eastern Mitchell County where there were numerous reports of large hail up to golf ball size, a measured wind gust of 73 MPH and estimated gusts up to 90 MPH. Not surprisingly, significant crop damage and some structure damage was reported, including windows broken out of homes and a destroyed farm Quonset building near Asherville. Also near Asherville, a semi truck slid off of Highway 24 in an area where golf ball size hail covered the road. The most intense core of this storm passed only a few miles to the south and east of Beloit, narrowly sparing the city.   Before this storm made early-morning headlines, it initially appeared that this entire North Central Kansas area would miss out on severe weather given that other clusters of severe convection during the preceding 12 hours instead focused just to the north over south central Nebraska and to the east within northeast Kansas. However, as increasing large-scale ascent pushed into Kansas from the west during the pre-dawn hours and intercepted the western fringes of a modest instability axis, a small line of storms first showed signs of intensification in the Ellis and southern Rooks County area around 5 am CDT. Within a short time, a portion of this line morphed into a semi-discrete strong to severe storm across southern Osborne County before really taking off over Mitchell County after 6 am CDT. On the synoptic scale aloft, this early-autumn event focused just downstream from a sharpening mid-upper trough axis aligned at sunrise from the central Dakotas to a mid level vort max over southeast Colorado. At the surface, this storm was post-frontal, as it formed slightly behind a modest cold front that passed through North Central Kansas during the night. Instability-wise, there was seemingly little support for such a robust early-morning storm given that most-unstable CAPE was only analyzed to be around 500 J/kg in the presence of surface dewpoints generally in the mid-50s F. However, 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear was certainly supportive of potential severe weather, having risen into the 50-60 knot range ahead of the approaching trough.",39.4685,-97.983

525125,6/15/2014 5:57,66,MG,nan,"During a month that had several rounds of severe weather in South Central Nebraska, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east through most locations near and south of Interstate 80 during the later evening. Earlier in the event, more discrete convection resulted primarily in numerous reports of severe-criteria hail, some as large as tennis ball to grapefruit size, along with four confirmed, brief EF0 tornadoes that yielded no reports of damage. The first of these tornadoes occurred in northwestern Franklin County near Hildreth around 730 pm CDT. The other three tornadoes were associated with a supercell storm that drifted northeast out of Kansas along a path from Webster to Hamilton counties before being absorbed into a larger line of convection. The first of these tornadoes was sighted in far southwestern Webster County around 830 pm CDT while the final two brief touchdowns occurred after nightfall in southwestern Hamilton County between Trumbull and Giltner between 1000-1030 pm CDT. In terms of hail, the largest confirmed stone of 4.25 fell three miles southeast of Hastings around 930 pm CDT. Other notable hail reports included stones up to baseball size along the Nance-Merrick County line, in and near Gibbon, near Ayr and in Arapahoe. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across roughly the southern half of the 24-county area later in the evening ended up being the big story of this event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through essentially all areas between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 82 MPH by a storm chaser near the Interstate 80 York exit, 79 MPH at Hastings airport, and 76 MPH at home weather stations near Davenport and Ohiowa. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and also damaged several structures, including outbuildings, grain bins and power poles. To cite just a few examples of this damage as it progressed from west to east: at Harlan County Lake at least four small boats were rammed into the shore and a camping trailer was overturned onto a vehicle, in Guide Rock a garage was blown off its foundation and partially onto a roadway, and at the Nuckolls County fairgrounds in Nelson a tin roof was removed from a barn, the roof of the arena was damaged and a camper was flipped on its side. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most storms, rainfall totals across much of South Central Nebraska did not exceed 1-2 inches. However, a southwest-to-northeast corridor of 2-3 and locally higher rainfall centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Wilcox-Grand Island-Genoa, featuring NeRAIN observer totals of 4.13 three miles west-southwest of Genoa and 4.06 two miles of Doniphan.  Breaking down event timing, the initial round of at least semi-discrete convection, including a few supercells, flared up between 530-730 pm CDT within a fairly narrow southwest-to-northeast oriented corridor along a slow-moving but well-defined cold front. Most of this early convection concentrated several miles either side of a line from near Franklin and Red Cloud in the south, then north-northeast through the Hastings-Grand Island-Central City-Fullerton areas. Generally between 730-930 pm CDT, this initially narrow corridor of storms gradually expanded in coverage to both the west and east. Then, even as ongoing convection remained strong to severe, the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of southwest Nebraska, entering southwestern portions of the local area between 930-1030 pm CDT. For the next few hours generally between 1030 pm to 1 am CDT, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of roughly the southern half of South Central Nebraska, while the far northern end of the line gradually merged with the earlier convection that had largely lifted north of Interstate 80 by this time and had weakened somewhat. Finally, between 1-2 am CDT, the line of severe storms cleared the far eastern edges of the local area near the Highway 81 corridor, leaving behind only a trailing zone of stratiform rain that lingered into the pre-dawn hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska by early evening. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the upper-80s to lower-90s F while dewpoints generally held in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/expanded the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.4089,-97.4851
530462,6/21/2014 2:46,66,MG,A thunderstorm wind gust was measured at 76 mph.,"Although ground-truth reports of severe-criteria hail and wind emanated from only seven counties mainly within northern and central portions of South Central Nebraska on this Friday, the coverage of non-severe thunderstorms and locally heavy rain became rather widespread across much of the area during the late evening and lasting into the early morning hours of the 21st. Despite the somewhat limited areal coverage of verified severe storms, this was a more-significant-than-expected and fairly long-lasting event, as 25 severe thunderstorm warnings were issued in the local area over the course of eight hours between 230-1030 pm CDT, including for a storm that pounded parts of Grand Island with hail up to baseball size.    Several hours prior to the primary severe weather event, a lone morning storm dropped nickel size hail as it passed through Valley and Greeley counties. During the early stages of the main afternoon/evening development, generally between 230-500 pm CDT, transient clusters of strong to marginally severe multicell storms affected areas north of Highway 92, producing ping pong ball size hail near Cotesfield. The next few hours featured the storms of the day as a pair of very slow-moving supercells pounded the northern Hall and southern Howard county area. For the city of Grand Island, the first of these storms likely resulted in the most significant severe event of the 2014 convective season, as a swath extending from a few miles northwest of the city to near the downtown area was drilled with hail stones ranging from quarter to baseball size between mainly 6-7 pm CDT. During this same time frame, a separate, smaller severe storm in Sherman County dropped very large hail up to 3 in diameter in the Rockville area. As the initial Grand Island supercell started dissipating, a second supercell flared up just to its west over northwestern Hall County mainly between 730-830 pm CDT, pounding the Cairo area with hail up to golf ball size for several minutes. While this second supercell started to weaken, a considerable flare-up of strong to severe multicell convection commenced between 730-900 pm CDT within several northern and western counties such as Sherman, Dawson, Gosper and Furnas, resulting in a few reports of estimated 60-65 MPH winds. Generally between 9-11 pm CDT, much of this widespread convection rapidly congealed into a southeast-surging quasi-linear complex that took aim on the Tri-Cities area. During this time, measured wind gusts in Hall County included 58 MPH at the Grand Island airport and 76 MPH at a home weather station near Wood River. These damaging gusts then barreled into Adams County where Hastings airport measured a 67 MPH gust, resulting in the second round of tree damage and fairly minor structural damage within the city in less than one weeks time. Beyond 11 pm CDT, there were no further reports of severe storms within South Central Nebraska, although widespread redevelopment of convection continued through the night, especially near the Interstate 80 and Highway 6 corridors. By the end of the night, most of the 24-county area had tallied anywhere from 0.50 to 2 of rain. However, much higher pockets of at least 3-4 of rain targeted primarily northern Hall and southern Howard counties, northern Adams County and central/western Clay County. A few of the highest storm totals from a combination of automated gauges, NWS cooperative observers and NeRAIN observers included 4.07 five miles west-southwest of Clay Center, 3.31 at Hastings airport and 3.11 three miles east-southeast of Dannebrog. Not surprisingly, short-term flooding issues materialized. While rain was still falling during the evening, water was reported over several county roads in southwestern Howard County, along with Highway 11 near Dannebrog. After daybreak on the 21st, reports arrived of several county roads in northwestern Adams County covered in water.     In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this was not really a synoptically-evident severe weather setup, thanks largely to the lack of a notable mid-upper level disturbance and also seasonably-weak deep layer wind shear. As a result, the severity/longevity of this event was largely underestimated in official forecasts, even within 12 hours of its onset. In the mid levels, fairly weak quasi-zonal flow containing very subtle disturbances was in place over Nebraska, well to the south of a compact-but-strong closed low churning over Saskatchewan and Manitoba. At the surface, only a few subtle boundaries were present within the region, but no well-defined fronts. However, as afternoon temperatures rose well into the upper 80s-low 90s F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s, significant instability developed in the form of mixed-layer CAPE soaring to between 3000-4000 J/kg. Despite 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear averaging no more than 20-30 knots, this highly unstable environment supported robust convection, including the few slow-moving supercells. After dark, the briefly-severe squall line and subsequent multi-hour period of regenerative non-severe storms was aided by the exit region of a 30-40 knot low level jet centered over western KS.",40.81,-98.6

Minor damage was reported to one hotel roof.,"A potent fall storm system moved out of the Rockies and across the Southern Plains during the late afternoon and evening hours of the 12th.

525137,6/15/2014 4:25,67,MG,A line of thunderstorms producing damaging winds moved through Jewell County. The cooperative observer in Burr Oak estimated wind gusts near 70 MPH and a home weather station near Webber measured a 77 MPH wind gust at 1146 pm CDT.  An outbuilding was destroyed a few miles south of the Kansas state line on Highway 128.,"During a month with several rounds of severe weather in this six-county portion of North Central Kansas, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east across the area in the form of an intense forward-propagating squall line. A few hours prior to these severe winds entering the local area, an isolated supercell storm cluster drifted slowly northeast across parts of Rooks, Phillips and Smith counties before departing into Nebraska, producing one highly-visible, short-track landspout tornado and a few reports of quarter to golf ball size hail. The EF1-rated tornado, which touched down around 530 pm CDT near Webster State Park shortly after storms first initiated, damaged power poles and fencing along its brief path. In terms of hail, the largest reported golf ball size stones fell in the Glade area shortly after the dissipation of the Rooks County tornado. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across the six-county area later in the evening was truly the main event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through nearly every square mile of North Central Kansas. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 86 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport and 77 MPH at a home weather station near Webber. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and likely also damaged several structures. Based on a limited number of damage reports that were received, one of the more newsworthy incidents involved several campers blown over at Webster State Park, along with a roof blown off a cabin. Due to the progressive nature of these storms, rainfall totals across most of North Central Kansas averaged less than 1.   Breaking down event timing, the initial supercell cluster that produced the landspout tornado in northern Rooks County flared up between 5-6 pm CDT near the leading edge of the invading cold front. As this storm cluster slowly drifted northeast through Smith County, it evolved into a more compact-but-organized discrete supercell that exited northward into Nebraska around 830 pm CDT. This storms departure ushered in a nearly two-hour lull in local thunderstorm activity, before the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of northwest Kansas into Phillips and Rooks counties between 10-11 pm CDT. For the next few hours, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of the six-county area before gradually departing the eastern edges of Jewell and Mitchell counties between 12-1 am CDT, leaving behind only a trailing area of stratiform rain that lingered for a few more hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged southeastward into North Central Kansas during the evening, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the low-mid 90s F while dewpoints generally averaged in the mid-60s F.

519853,6/3/2014 23:38,69,MG,The automated surface observing system at the Ord Airport reported a 79 mph wind gust.,"For roughly the northeast half of this 24-county South Central Nebraska area, this late Tuesday afternoon and evening featured one of the most widespread severe weather events of the 2014 convective season. In essence, three separate waves of primarily outflow-dominant convection rolled across the area along a west-northwest to east-southeast path over the course of several hours, resulting in dozens of reports of large hail and damaging winds, along with three fairly brief tornadoes, two rated EF0 and one EF1. There was a notably sharp cutoff in severe thunderstorm activity within South Central Nebraska, as nearly all storms concentrated northeast of a line from roughly Litchfield-Hastings-Geneva, while most locations southwest of this line did not even observe a single raindrop. Starting with the three tornadoes, the first two were brief, EF0 touchdowns that occurred in far northern Valley and north central Greeley counties during the 415-515 pm CDT time frame, and were associated with the first supercell storm of the event that tracked into the local area from the west-northwest. These tornadoes produced little if any direct damage. The third confirmed tornado of the event was a bit more significant, and occurred several hours later after dark, around 1030 pm CDT in eastern Hamilton County north of Hampton. This EF1 tornado struck two homes, blowing a portion of the roof off of one of them. As for large hail, there were several reports of stones up to around golf ball size in places such as Spalding, Osceola, Arcadia, York, McCool Junction and Exeter. Many places were hit with more than one round of hail, including York, where golf ball size hail first fell around 830 pm CDT and then again around 11 pm CDT. In many cases, hail was accompanied by severe outflow winds of generally 60-80 MPH, resulting in broken windows and siding damage to several structures, along with tree damage. As just a few specific examples of wind reports and damage: Ord airport measured a 79 MPH gust, a rural residence four miles northeast of Scotia sustained considerable damage to outbuildings along with broken house windows, and a grocery store in Wolbach had its roof peeled back. In addition to damaging winds directly associated with severe storms, places farther south near the Highway 6 corridor, including Hastings, observed the passage of a notably strong, southward-surging outflow boundary around 8 pm CDT that produced measured 70+ MPH winds and significant blowing dust. At the time this outflow plowed through Hastings, the nearest precipitation associated with actual thunderstorms was at least 15-20 miles off to the north-northeast. As for event-total rainfall, most of the affected areas tallied somewhere between 1-3, although localized higher amounts occurred mainly in Nance and Polk counties, including NeRAIN observer totals of 3.70 two miles west-northwest of Shelby and 3.68 seven miles north of Osceola.   Taking a closer look at severe weather timing, the morning actually started out with a cluster of strong storms that rumbled through many of the same northern counties that would later see the main event. These early-day storms produced nickel size hail in Arcadia, but by 930 am CDT all morning activity had exited South Central Nebraska, kicking off a multi-hour lull. Then, generally between 430-630 pm CDT, round 1 of severe storms, anchored by an outflow-dominant supercell that produced the EF0 tornadoes, raked across mainly the far northern and northeastern fringes of the local area before exiting into eastern Nebraska. Around the time round 1 was exiting stage right, round 2 of severe storms entered Valley and Greeley counties from the northwest between 6-7 pm CDT and tracked east-southeast for the next few hours before exiting the eastern York County area around 9 pm CDT. Following a very similar theme, round 3 of severe storms initially intensified over the Valley/Sherman counties area between 830-930 pm CDT, and proceeded to pass east-southeast over many of the same areas as the previous round. However this final cluster of fairly fast-moving severe storms slipped a touch farther southeast, affecting more of the Fillmore County area before exiting into eastern Nebraska around 1230 am CDT on the 4th. Although a few non-severe storms lingered a bit later near the Interstate 80 corridor, essentially all of South Central Nebraska was finally storm-free by 230 am CDT.  On the mid-upper level synoptic scale, the main trigger for this event was an energetic, although fairly-low amplitude shortwave trough that raced out of the Intermountain West and into the Central Plains. A corresponding westerly mid-level speed max of around 60-70 knots at 500 millibars accompanied this wave, which combined with steepening mid level lapse rates and surface dewpoints generally in the low-mid 60s F to yield a fairly volatile late afternoon/early evening mesoscale environment featuring around 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and a notable 60-70 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer shear. Low level shear and storm-relative helicity also became quite pronounced in the vicinity of a fairly sharp surface warm front that became quasi-stationary through much of the day and evening along an axis through northwest-central-southeast Nebraska. Despite the considerable severe weather that occurred, there were indications leading up to the event that it could have been worse. For one thing, the mesoscale environment was initially supportive of more destructive, longer-track tornadoes, but this threat steadily diminished as most storms quickly became outflow-dominant and generated a larger-scale cold pool. Secondly, the areal coverage of severe storms was not as widespread as it could have been, as a mid level capping inversion south of the strong warm front spared most of the southwest half of the local area from observing any convection. At any rate, this severe weather event was well-anticipated at least a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",41.62,-98.95

524767,6/15/2014 4:49,69,MG,nan,"During a month that had several rounds of severe weather in South Central Nebraska, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east through most locations near and south of Interstate 80 during the later evening. Earlier in the event, more discrete convection resulted primarily in numerous reports of severe-criteria hail, some as large as tennis ball to grapefruit size, along with four confirmed, brief EF0 tornadoes that yielded no reports of damage. The first of these tornadoes occurred in northwestern Franklin County near Hildreth around 730 pm CDT. The other three tornadoes were associated with a supercell storm that drifted northeast out of Kansas along a path from Webster to Hamilton counties before being absorbed into a larger line of convection. The first of these tornadoes was sighted in far southwestern Webster County around 830 pm CDT while the final two brief touchdowns occurred after nightfall in southwestern Hamilton County between Trumbull and Giltner between 1000-1030 pm CDT. In terms of hail, the largest confirmed stone of 4.25 fell three miles southeast of Hastings around 930 pm CDT. Other notable hail reports included stones up to baseball size along the Nance-Merrick County line, in and near Gibbon, near Ayr and in Arapahoe. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across roughly the southern half of the 24-county area later in the evening ended up being the big story of this event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through essentially all areas between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 82 MPH by a storm chaser near the Interstate 80 York exit, 79 MPH at Hastings airport, and 76 MPH at home weather stations near Davenport and Ohiowa. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and also damaged several structures, including outbuildings, grain bins and power poles. To cite just a few examples of this damage as it progressed from west to east: at Harlan County Lake at least four small boats were rammed into the shore and a camping trailer was overturned onto a vehicle, in Guide Rock a garage was blown off its foundation and partially onto a roadway, and at the Nuckolls County fairgrounds in Nelson a tin roof was removed from a barn, the roof of the arena was damaged and a camper was flipped on its side. Due to the fairly progressive nature of most storms, rainfall totals across much of South Central Nebraska did not exceed 1-2 inches. However, a southwest-to-northeast corridor of 2-3 and locally higher rainfall centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Wilcox-Grand Island-Genoa, featuring NeRAIN observer totals of 4.13 three miles west-southwest of Genoa and 4.06 two miles of Doniphan.  Breaking down event timing, the initial round of at least semi-discrete convection, including a few supercells, flared up between 530-730 pm CDT within a fairly narrow southwest-to-northeast oriented corridor along a slow-moving but well-defined cold front. Most of this early convection concentrated several miles either side of a line from near Franklin and Red Cloud in the south, then north-northeast through the Hastings-Grand Island-Central City-Fullerton areas. Generally between 730-930 pm CDT, this initially narrow corridor of storms gradually expanded in coverage to both the west and east. Then, even as ongoing convection remained strong to severe, the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of southwest Nebraska, entering southwestern portions of the local area between 930-1030 pm CDT. For the next few hours generally between 1030 pm to 1 am CDT, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of roughly the southern half of South Central Nebraska, while the far northern end of the line gradually merged with the earlier convection that had largely lifted north of Interstate 80 by this time and had weakened somewhat. Finally, between 1-2 am CDT, the line of severe storms cleared the far eastern edges of the local area near the Highway 81 corridor, leaving behind only a trailing zone of stratiform rain that lingered into the pre-dawn hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska by early evening. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the upper-80s to lower-90s F while dewpoints generally held in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed most of South Central Nebraska in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/expanded the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",40.6,-98.43

Along this main corridor, a sampling of the most wind significant reports in chronological order included: estimated 70 MPH winds in the Elyria and Litchfield areas with crop and tree damage, a measured 71 MPH gust near Wood River, a measured peak gust of 83 MPH at Hastings airport along with 10-20 minutes of persistent 60-80 MPH wind behind the initial surge, and up to 30 minutes of estimated 60-70 MPH gusts in Superior. Off to the west of this main zone of wind issues, there were a few reports of gusts around 60 MPH in the Lexington and Arapahoe areas. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection kept totals in most places no higher than 0.50-1.50 inches, with a few of the wetter exceptions per NeRAIN observes featuring 2.30 nine miles northwest of Ord and 2.13 six miles southeast of Davenport.   In a basic sense, this event consisted of an initially semi-discrete supercell cluster that first developed in north central Nebraska during the mid-afternoon hours and then gradually grew upscale into a larger-scale, forward-propagating linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) as it crossed the local South Central Nebraska area. This intense storm complex first infiltrated the local area into Valley/Sherman/Dawson counties between 630-730 pm CDT, blew through the Grand Island/Hastings areas during the 815-930 pm CDT time frame and finally departed southeastward into northern Kansas between 10-11 pm CDT. Although showers/weak storms lingered over mainly eastern counties a bit longer, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska was void of precipitation by 1 am CDT on the 18th.   By late-summer standards, this synoptic and mesoscale setup was fairly ripe for an organized severe weather event. In the mid-upper levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough brushed into Nebraska from the northwest, along the southern periphery of a larger scale disturbance centered over southern Saskatchewan/Manitoba. As a result, mid-upper level flow increased enough to promote generally 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear over South Central Nebraska. In addition, instability was quite potent as the combination of afternoon surface temperatures in the upper-80s/near 90 F and dewpoints in the mid-60s/low-70s promoted mixed-layer CAPE values of 2000-4000 J/kg ahead of the incoming convective complex.",40.6,-98.43

At 850 millibars, the low level jet pushed juicy air up into southeast North Dakota and west central Minnesota, with drier air to the north. Finally, forty-five to fifty knot westerly winds at 500 millibars provided ample shear to the system. Thunderstorms over western and central North Dakota proceeded east and moved into Barnes County, North Dakota, during the first few hours of the 4th. These storms tracked nearly due east, finally exiting Wadena County, Minnesota, around sunrise. The strongest storms mainly stayed along and south of Interstate 94 in North Dakota and U. S.

Isolated thunderstorms occurred through the afternoon over the Sandhills, generally dissipating as they moved southeast into South Central Nebraska. However, by late afternoon thunderstorms intensified with supercells and high-end multicells becoming dominant. The most intense storm of this event produced a prolific swath of significant severe weather. This storm formed over Loup County around 4 p.m. CDT and subsequently tracked south-southeastward through Valley, Sherman, eastern Buffalo, Adams and Webster counties. By 9 p.m. CDT, the storm finally reached the Nebraska-Kansas border. It was responsible for producing hail up to the size of golf balls and winds of 60 to 90 MPH. Hail turned the ground white from Loup City to Ravenna to Gibbon. Combined with the severe winds, tremendous damage occurred to many homes with vinyl siding in these areas. Windows were even broken. The hail and wind caused severe crop damage as well, stripping the corn of its leaves and leaving little but shredded stalks. The scar from damaged crops remained visible, in even relatively low-resolution GOES satellite imagery, the rest of the summer. A semi-tractor trailer was blown on its side on Interstate 80, just southeast of Kearney. Winds were measured as high as 85 MPH in the town of Norman. Other storms became severe over the Sandhills and affected other portions of Valley, Greeley, Howard and Sherman counties during the early to mid-evening hours. These storms also produce hail up to the size of golf balls. Scattered thunderstorms continued to develop into the late evening and even the overnight hours from Broken Bow southward to Beaver City. Winds were estimated between 60 and 70 MPH with some of these storms, along with hail up to the size of ping pong balls.  These storms all developed in an upslope flow regime, north of a quasi-stationary front, with high pressure over the Midwest. The front extended from northwest to southeast across Nebraska and bisected South Central Nebraska, separating temperatures in the 80s to near 90 from rain cooled air in the 60s and 70s, during the late afternoon hours. Aloft, subtropical high pressure was over New Mexico with a low amplitude ridge over the Rockies and a trough over the eastern United States.

A sustained wind speed of 67 MPH was also recorded by the AWOS. This wind was accompanied by large hail of unknown size, which resulted in windows being broken out of a vehicle in Phillipsburg.  Numerous trees were damaged, with some being uprooted, and large limbs were downed.","During a month with several rounds of severe weather in this six-county portion of North Central Kansas, what transpired on this Saturday evening into the very early morning of Sunday the 15th was likely one of the most significant severe weather events of the entire 2014 convective season, especially in terms of widespread wind damage that raked from west-to-east across the area in the form of an intense forward-propagating squall line. A few hours prior to these severe winds entering the local area, an isolated supercell storm cluster drifted slowly northeast across parts of Rooks, Phillips and Smith counties before departing into Nebraska, producing one highly-visible, short-track landspout tornado and a few reports of quarter to golf ball size hail. The EF1-rated tornado, which touched down around 530 pm CDT near Webster State Park shortly after storms first initiated, damaged power poles and fencing along its brief path. In terms of hail, the largest reported golf ball size stones fell in the Glade area shortly after the dissipation of the Rooks County tornado. However, in terms of widespread damage, the aforementioned severe squall line that rolled across the six-county area later in the evening was truly the main event. Based on known wind and damage reports (which likely only represented a fraction of the total, individual instances of storm damage across the area), this north-to-south oriented squall line produced a swath of 60-90 MPH gusts through nearly every square mile of North Central Kansas. In addition to several estimated severe wind speeds, a few of the most intense measured gusts included 86 MPH at the Phillipsburg airport and 77 MPH at a home weather station near Webber. Needless to say, a significant amount of wind damage occurred with this squall line as it uprooted or mangled countless trees and likely also damaged several structures. Based on a limited number of damage reports that were received, one of the more newsworthy incidents involved several campers blown over at Webster State Park, along with a roof blown off a cabin. Due to the progressive nature of these storms, rainfall totals across most of North Central Kansas averaged less than 1.   Breaking down event timing, the initial supercell cluster that produced the landspout tornado in northern Rooks County flared up between 5-6 pm CDT near the leading edge of the invading cold front. As this storm cluster slowly drifted northeast through Smith County, it evolved into a more compact-but-organized discrete supercell that exited northward into Nebraska around 830 pm CDT. This storms departure ushered in a nearly two-hour lull in local thunderstorm activity, before the leading edges of the incoming, intense squall line raced out of northwest Kansas into Phillips and Rooks counties between 10-11 pm CDT. For the next few hours, this fierce, bowing line raced across the remainder of the six-county area before gradually departing the eastern edges of Jewell and Mitchell counties between 12-1 am CDT, leaving behind only a trailing area of stratiform rain that lingered for a few more hours.   On the synoptic scale, this was a fairly classic June setup for significant severe, as a progressive mid level shortwave trough kicked out of the Rockies and into the Central Plains, rotating around the southeast periphery of a parent closed low anchored over the Montana/Saskatchewan border area. As this occurred, strengthening and increasingly-diffluent mid-upper southwesterly flow overspread the local area. At the surface, a slow-moving cold front edged southeastward into North Central Kansas during the evening, embedded within an elongated 992-996 millibar low pressure center stretched from western Kansas into eastern Nebraska. During the late-afternoon to mid-evening time frame, temperatures gradually decreased from highs in the low-mid 90s F while dewpoints generally averaged in the mid-60s F. Mesoscale severe weather parameters during the early-mid evening featured 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE in the presence of 40-60 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer vertical wind shear. As the evening wore on, low level shear intensified as the nose of a 50-60 knot low level jet focused into the area. This severe weather outbreak was well-anticipated a few days in advance at both the local WFO level as well as by the Storm Prediction Center, which already placed much of North Central Kansas in a Moderate Risk on the Day 2 outlooks 24-48 hours in advance and maintained/refined the Moderate Risk area into the Day 1 period.",39.75,-99.32

Downdraft CAPE rose to to around 1000 J/kg, with about 600 J/kg of CAPE available in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere.  The freezing level was around 14,000 feet.  The atmosphere was highly sheared with 50 to 80 kts of shear available.  A strong 70 to 80 kt mid level jet moved into the area as the low level jet increased to around 60 kts by evening.  Precipitable water values were around 2 inches, which is more than three sigma above seasonal normals.  The LCL level was fairly low, around 1000 meters. Thunderstorms that formed to the west quickly became an upscale MCC as it continue southeast.  The strongest storms formed along the baroclinic zone of the warm front.  Windspread severe weather occurred, but was limited to the far southwest part of the CWA.

These storms were primarily damaging wind-producers. However, the one known severe-criteria hail report was a significant one as golf ball to softball size stones occurred near Agra. Wind-wise, the initial storm complex that moved into the area from northwest Kansas yielded severe-criteria measured gusts at Logan (58 MPH) and Phillipsburg airport (67 MPH). A bit later in the evening, following the merger of the first storm complex with a stronger, larger MCS diving southeastward out of south central Nebraska, Jewell and Mitchell counties bore the brunt of damaging winds including estimated 70 MPH winds in Mankato, a measured 86 MPH gust near Jewell, and a report of tree branches downed throughout Beloit. Rainfall-wise, the progressive nature of convection held amounts under 1 inch in most places.    Timing-wise, the first storm complex tracked into Phillips and Rooks counties from the west between 7-8 pm CDT, having grown upscale from its humble late-afternoon beginnings along western portions of the Kansas-Nebraska border. As this initial area of convection reached far eastern portions of Smith and Osborne counties around 930 pm CDT, its northern end quickly merged with the leading edges of a stronger linear MCS charging southeastward out of Nebraska. During the ensuing hour, strong to severe winds swept through Jewell and Mitchell counties before departing the local area to the east and southeast. Although showers/weak storms lingered over some places a bit longer, the vast majority of the local area was void of precipitation by 1230 am CDT on the 18th.

The ridge broke down on the 1st of August and was overrun by two weak midlevel impulses on August 2nd.  As the second impulse passed over Central Washington during the late afternoon, strong to severe storms developed over the Waterville Plateau producing a combination of heavy rain and moderate size hail.  Meanwhile, dewpoint depressions over Eastern Washington had grown between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  The rain and hail cooled outflow winds from storms over the Waterville Plateau spread east and gained momentum while tracking along the Highway 2 corridor across the Upper Columbia Basin.  Additional storms fired along the gust front and continued to reinforce the cold pool and resultant winds.  Gusty winds and blowing dust which originated over the Waterville Plateau traveled across Banks Lake and through much of Lincoln County but generally remained below severe speeds.  It wasnt until the outflow boundary moved into Eastern Lincoln County and Lake Roosevelt near Seven Bays Marina when wind speeds ranged between 60 and 70 miles per hour.  The winds led to numerous downed trees, waves four to six feet on Lake Roosevelt, widespread boat damage, power outages, and structural damage.  The winds also fanned new wildfire starts from lightning.  As the afternoon progressed, a combination of forcing from the shortwave and gust front continued to fuel additional storms over Northeastern Washington.   Outflow winds from these storms generally moved north to south.  As the north to south boundaries interacted with the westerly boundaries, some locations were spared experiencing wind gusts between 35 and 45 mph.  In this absence, winds of 50 to 70 mph were observed coupled with widespread tree damage.  A few storms briefly produced quarter size hail between Davenport and Northwest Spokane.",47.9174,-118.7608
