Conditions became increasingly favorable for thunderstorms during the afternoon as moisture streamed northward. The greatest moisture and resultant instability was confined to areas south of the Texas panhandle and east into Oklahoma. Nevertheless, minor instability did result in thunderstorms that became severe producing large hail and damaging winds. There were two rounds of severe thunderstorms. One occurred during the early to mid evening across the southeast Texas Panhandle. Hail up to quarter size was reported in portions of Donley and Collingsworth counties with these storms. A second round of thunderstorms formed in New Mexico as the main storm system moved closer to the area. These thunderstorms moved into the southwest and central Texas Panhandle. Since the air mass over this portion of the area was much drier, storms struggled to intensify and produced little or no lightning. However, they were very efficient wind producers and wind gusts of 50 to 55 mph were common from Deaf Smith and Oldham county into western Potter and Randall counties. As the storms moved through Amarillo, little or no rain reached the ground but wind gusts up to 68 mph were measured. These storms weakened further as they moved northeast into Roberts and Gray County. Wind gusts near 60 mph were measured in these two counties but no lightning was observed by this time.",35.42,-101.93

633266,4/19/2016 3:16,50,MG,ASOS at the Rio Grande Valley International Airport in Harlingen recorded a peak wind gust of 58 mph.,"A broken line of thunderstorms marched across the Rio Grande Valley through the late afternoon and evening hours and combined with other development across Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, Mexico to form a convective system. This initially stabilized the atmosphere and held back development. However, the continued flow from the east/northeast ran into northward moving boundaries from storms in Tamaulipas/Nuevo Leon to form a severe storm over Port Isabel and South Padre Island, with the first report of large hail at 745 pm LST. Soon after, outflow from this storm would link up with others from the Mexico storms and a small but potent local convective system soon formed between Harlingen and Brownsville. Downburst winds, reached 58 mph at KHRL and knocked down a number of power lines, blew some shingles off one apartment complex, and blew off at least one poorly fastened carport on the east side of Harlingen. Strong winds from the south, once again, due to the sharp difference in high and low pressure within the region – propagated through the Lower Rio Grande Valley, producing a 60 mph gust at KHRL just after 12 am LST on the 19th and causing additional damage to at least one tin roof (Bass Boulevard, west side) and at least one fence in town. Additional minor damage may have occurred in Brownsville during the same period, as the peak wind at KBRO reached 54 mph at 1255 am LST on the 19th.

Instability became moderate to high ahead of an upper level disturbance that moved out of the intermountain west and into the plains.  Deep layer shear was significant enough that storm mode was supercells which developed along a prefrontal trough axis across portions of Central Oklahoma and North Central Texas.  Low level shear was significant enough such that once these storms became supercells, they produced tornadoes...some extreme with long tracks across portions of Oklahoma.  These storms propagated eastward through the evening and moved into McCurtain County, Oklahoma and the adjacent counties in Northeast Texas, as well as portions of Southwest Arkansas.  By the time the storms moved into these areas, they mostly produced straight line wind damage but a couple short lived tornadoes did develop across the region as well as some large hail.  The damage was extreme, consisting of numerous trees snapped and/or uprooted with some of these having fallen on homes and automobiles across Red River and Bowie Counties in Northeast Texas.

Already by noon CDT, strong thunderstorms were underway in Phillips County along a cold front advancing southeast through the region. Over the course of the next few hours convection increased in coverage and intensity as it marched across most of North Central Kansas, primarily producing sporadic wind damage and brief, torrential rainfall. Along the way, a few of the more notable storm reports included: estimated 70 MPH winds south of Alton accompanied by nickel size hail and over 2 of rain in a short time leading to localized flash flooding; measured severe-criteria wind gusts of 78 MPH in Beloit, 63 MPH at Simpson and 60 MPH near Jewell. Between 3-4 p.m. CDT, the main batch of strong to severe storms steadily departed the local area to the east and southeast, ending the severe weather threat for the day. Shortly thereafter, additional storms briefly flared up over Mitchell County but produced only heavy rain, and the entire six-county area was storm-free for the day by 6:30 p.m. CDT. Rainfall-wise, the majority of this North Central Kansas area tallied between 0.50-2.00, with slightly higher amounts focused within southwestern Phillips, central Osborne and southern and eastern Mitchell counties, where brief flooding issues were most prevalent.   By mid-August standards, the surface cold front that sparked this event was reasonably-strong, featuring gusty north winds in its wake and steadily-falling dewpoints. Just ahead of the front during the early-mid afternoon, surface temperatures climbed into the 80s F with dewpoints into the mid-upper 60s, fostering appreciable mixed-layer CAPE of at least 2000 J/kg. Deep layer wind shear was fairly modest at around 30 knots, resulting in a predominant multicell/quasi-linear storm mode.

665609,12/25/2016 18:51,52,MG,A thunderstorm wind gust of 60 MPH was recorded along a line of thunderstorms.,"The weather on Christmas 2016 was so unusual that its probably a safe bet to categorize it as once in a lifetime Christmas weather for this six-county North Central Kansas area. While some past Christmases are remembered for more traditional significant winter weather such as snow, this one will go down in the record books for spring-like severe thunderstorms with damaging winds and even the first December tornado confirmed in this portion of northern Kansas since at least 1950 (when reliable records began). Then, later in the afternoon/evening, the Phillips County area endured an intense damaging wind event featuring sustained values of 30-50 MPH for a few hours and brief peak gusts around 70 MPH. These winds resulted in mainly minor damage to trees and power lines, and also flipped over several irrigation pivots. Because specific storm reports from this area were fairly sparse, the few official reports documented here likely reflect only some of the significant weather observed within North Central Kansas on this day.   Focusing more detail on the thunderstorms and tornado, the culprit was a narrow, strongly forced squall line that steadily advanced across the entire local area from west-to-east. Timing-wise, this was a fairly early show as convection first entered Rooks/Phillips counties around 11 AM and exited Jewell/Mitchell counties only a few hours later between 1:00-1:30 PM. While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were a few transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and one confirmed, short-track tornado. This EF1-rated tornado touched down northwest of Alton around 11:45 AM and tipped over an empty bulk bin and caused very minor damage to a home.   Even though the day had already featured highly-unusual and locally-damaging Christmas weather, for parts of especially Phillips County the worst was yet to come in the form of early-evening damaging winds. While the vast majority of wind damage associated with this event focused to the north into Nebraska, automated sensors in both Phillipsburg and Logan clocked gusts of 70 MPH from the west-southwest shortly after 5 PM, followed by up to a few hours of sustained speeds to around 40 MPH before easing up. Although gusty evening winds likely brushed into adjacent local counties as well, no known reports breached High Wind Warning criteria. Forecast-wise, while fairly stout winds were anticipated to move in behind the departing low, the ferocity of peak gusts exceeded expectations.   Closing with an examination of the meteorological setup, it certainly was more reminiscent of March or April in North Central Kansas than late-December. In the mid-upper levels, a powerful, negatively-tilted vorticity maximum deepened over the course of the day as it emerged from the Central Rockies, reaching north central Nebraska by early evening. Just to the southeast of the mid-level low center, a formidable upper jet streak of 120+ knots migrated overhead. At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge north into Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising well into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the upper-40s to mid-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging winds in the Phillips County area.",39.454,-98.09

These two storms moved southeast across central and southern Minnesota and produced a swath of damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes during the late afternoon and early evening. Crop specialists from the University of Minnesota Extension service indicated that corn and soybean yields had some damage in central Minnesota, especially around Willmar. Corn had broken or bruised stalks, along with dislodged roots and leaf loss from the wind and hail.   The northern storm went from Alexandria, southeast to Paynesville, Buffalo and the northwest part of the Twin Cities metro area.

The two storms merged across southern Minnesota from near Faribault, northeast to Red Wing, and to near Eau Claire Wisconsin. This storm rapidly moved southeast and became a large bow echo that raced across southern Wisconsin, and northern Illinois by Wednesday morning.    The northern storm produced several measured wind gusts in excess of 70 mph across Wright, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington counties. The worst damage which a storm survey estimated winds near 80 mph, produced a six mile long damage path of downed transmission lines near St. Michaels and Rogers. As the storms moved into the western metro area, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, with measured severe wind gusts at both Crystal and Flying Cloud airports. The downtown St. Paul airport also measured a severe wind gust as the storms moved into Ramsey and into Washington county. The Maple Grove hospital had structural damage to their building. Pavers from an upper roof blew off and penetrated a roof below. This caused rain to seep into patient rooms and to the 1st floor imaging and PCC.

Then, isolated storms developed in the afternoon and produced severe hail. During the evening hours Tuesday, a mature squall line developed over the Sandhills. It propagated southeast and into the region beginning around 11:30 p.m. CST. The squall line was at peak intensity as it entered Dawson, Howard, and Valley Counties. It rapidly weakened after 12:30 a.m. CST. However, the remnant outflow continued to produce strong to severe winds through 3 a.m. CST, well after the deep convection had dissipated. Widespread winds between 50 and 60 mph were measured, but peak wind gusts included 61 mph at Grand Island, 63 mph near Oxford, 64 mph at Lexington, and 76 mph at Edison. Tree damage was reported in several locations, with trees blown over and tree limbs snapped off. The last strong wind gust measured was 56 mph at York, at 3:03 a.m. CST. Isolated power outages occurred across the region.  Later in the afternoon, a small cluster of multicell thunderstorms developed over the Sandhills. A few isolated storms managed to develop along the southwest flank of its outflow boundary, though most of them were weak, short-lived, and sub-severe. A single-cell storm, which exhibited multi-cell characteristics at times, dominated the other cells over Custer County. Just after 7 p.m. CST, this storm moved into northwest Buffalo County and produced a few reports of dime to quarter size hail. By 8 p.m. CST, the storm began weakening and then rapidly dissipated over southwest Buffalo County.  The surface map was complex. The thunderstorms that initially spawned the squall line developed between two fronts. A stationary front extended west from the mid-Atlantic region, through the mid-Mississippi Valley into Oklahoma, then northwest into western Kansas and Nebraska. A weak cold front extended from Lake Superior to the northwest tip of Nebraska into Wyoming and Idaho. The afternoon storms formed behind this front which was surging southward. It was located along the Nebraska-Kansas state line by 6 p.m. CST. In the upper levels, the Westerlies were fairly zonal over the northern third of the U.S., with subtropical highs over the Southwest and off the Carolina Coast. A weak shortwave trough was embedded in the Westerlies over the Dakotas Tuesday evening. By Wednesday evening, it had progressed into Minnesota and Iowa, with some slight amplification and more of a cyclonic look between the two highs. Just prior to the arrival of the squall line, surface temperatures were in the upper 60s to lower 70s, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were steep, between 7.5 and 7.9 degrees C/km, resulting in MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. Effectively deep layer shear was less than 25 kts. The MCS was moving out of an area of more favorable shear, resulting in the shear within the cold pool becoming dominant, and the demise of the deep convection. With the isolated hail producer later that evening, temperatures behind the front were in the lower 80s, with dewpoints still in the middle to upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were moist adiabatic.

652776,9/16/2016 4:18,53,MG,nan,"Widespread thunderstorms produced a few severe wind gusts and hail, along with heavy rain on this Thursday. The evolution of thunderstorms was complex during this event. Initially, two separate areas of thunderstorms initiated and organized during the late afternoon hours; one was over northeast Nebraska and the other was over northwest Kansas. In the latter location, the increasing number of storms, some of which were splitting-supercells, resulted in the eventual formation of a small bow echo over south central Nebraska by mid- to late-evening. Meanwhile, the storms over northeast Nebraska back-built into south central Nebraska in a linear fashion, intersecting with the developing bow echo comma-head. The first reported severe hail occurred at 5:45 p.m. CST near Holdrege, from an isolated right-moving supercell just after the split. The second report of hail occurred near Sumner and was associated with a left-moving supercell soon after the split. The first report of estimated severe winds occurred in Harlan County around 7:40 p.m. CST, just as the squall line was forming. The subsequent bow echo produced winds a couple other reports of severe winds in Webster and York Counties as well, but there was nothing in the way of damage reported. In fact, this bow echo did not produce severe winds in most locations. Significant rainfall occurred in a few locations, but it was most concentrated where Howard, Merrick, and Nance Counties meet. This is where the stationary line back-built to the western MCS. The heavy rain ended in this area as northern bookend vortex from the bow echo moved through. Rainfall of 3 to 5 inches was common in this area.  These MCSs formed in the warm sector of a weak low pressure system over South Dakota. The western storms formed along and ahead of the cold front, while the eastern storms formed in vicinity of the warm front. In the upper-levels, west-southwest flow was over the region, with a trough from the Northern Rockies back into Utah. A ridge was over the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes. Before the convection moved in, temperatures had cooled into the upper 70s, with dewpoints in the middle to upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were modest, slightly less than 7 deg C/km. Resultant MLCAPE was around 2500 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 30 to 40 kts, primarily in the initiation regions, but less in areas where the MCS activity matured.

670471,12/25/2016 18:57,54,MG,A peak wind gust of 62 MPH was measured by a home station on the north side of town. Small tree limbs were downed.,"The weather on Christmas 2016 was so significant and unusual that its probably a safe bet to categorize it as once in a lifetime Christmas weather for this 24-county South Central Nebraska area. While past Christmases (such as 2009) are remembered for more traditional significant winter weather such as heavy snow/blizzards, this one will go down in the record books for spring-like severe thunderstorms with damaging winds and the first three December tornadoes in Nebraska since 1975, followed by an intense damaging wind event during the evening hours featuring sustained values of 30-50 MPH and peak gusts generally 55-75 MPH. All things considered, the evening high winds were actually more impactful to the area as a whole than the daytime thunderstorms, given that fierce speeds persisted as long as two to three hours in most locations. These winds resulted in widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines (promoting several power outages) and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. In reality, the official convective and non-convective storm/damage reports documented here only capture a portion of all significant weather/damages observed within South Central Nebraska.   Focusing more detail on the thunderstorms and tornadoes, the culprit was a narrow, strongly forced squall line that steadily advanced across the entire local area from west-southwest to east-northeast. Timing-wise, this was a fairly early show as convection first entered far southwestern local counties such as Furnas/Gosper between 10:30-11:30 AM, swept through central areas including the Tri Cities between 12 PM and 1:30 PM and eventually exited far northeastern counties such as Polk/Nance between 2-3 PM. While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon. A few of the most significant damage reports not directly attributed to tornadic circulations included: construction trailers blown over and a barn destroyed on the west side of Kearney; and machine shed and tree damage southeast of Bruning.   Even though the day had already featured highly-unusual and locally-damaging Christmas weather, for many places the worst was yet to come in the form of the widespread evening damaging wind event, which largely unfolded under clear skies due to strong subsidence on the backside of an intense low pressure system. At nearly any given affected location, there were at least a few peak gusts of 60-75 MPH from the west-southwest, along with two to perhaps three hours of sustained speeds 30-50 MPH. Timing-wise, high winds rapidly overspread most of South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast, with severe-criteria gusts first measured in counties such as Furnas/Harlan shortly after 5 PM, central locations such as Grand Island/Hastings between 6-7 PM and far northern counties such as Valley by 8 PM. Finally, between 9:30 and 10:30 PM, winds eased below High Wind Warning criteria for the night. Based on dozens of reports from automated sensors, only the southeastern fringe of South Central Nebraska (generally southeast of a Red Cloud-Geneva line) was spared widespread damaging winds. Meanwhile, across the rest of the area, just a sampling of peak measured wind gusts included: 76 MPH at Aurora airport, 75 MPH at Grand Island airport and near Oxford, 73 MPH near Franklin, 72 MPH in Osceola and 71 MPH at the NWS office in Hastings. Needless to say, these evening winds resulted in fairly widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. Forecast-wise, while gusty winds were anticipated to move in behind the departing low, the ferocity of this event exceeded expectations.  Closing with an examination of the meteorological setup, it certainly was more reminiscent of March or April in South Central Nebraska than late-December. In the mid-upper levels, a powerful, negatively-tilted vorticity maximum deepened over the course of the day as it emerged from the Central Rockies, reaching north central Nebraska by early evening. Just to the southeast of the mid-level low center, a formidable upper jet streak of 120+ knots migrated overhead. At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the mid-40s to low-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging wind event.",40.58,-98.38

Very strong instability compensated for weak wind shear and allowed a few of these storms to become supercells and produce very large hail as they tracked slowly southeastward.  More numerous storms then surged south from the Texas Panhandle and resulted in a large, southward-moving storm complex that affected much of the South Plains and Rolling Plains through the evening.

These two storms moved southeast across central and southern Minnesota and produced a swath of damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes during the late afternoon and early evening. Crop specialists from the University of Minnesota Extension service indicated that corn and soybean yields had some damage in central Minnesota, especially around Willmar. Corn had broken or bruised stalks, along with dislodged roots and leaf loss from the wind and hail.   The northern storm went from Alexandria, southeast to Paynesville, Buffalo and the northwest part of the Twin Cities metro area. Eventually this storm moved across most of the Twin Cities metro area, with the most damage from northern Hennepin, through Ramsey and southern Washington.    The second storm followed a similar path from west central Minnesota, southeast to just north of the Minnesota River Valley, then across the southern part of the Twin Cities metro area. The two storms merged across southern Minnesota from near Faribault, northeast to Red Wing, and to near Eau Claire Wisconsin. This storm rapidly moved southeast and became a large bow echo that raced across southern Wisconsin, and northern Illinois by Wednesday morning.    The northern storm produced several measured wind gusts in excess of 70 mph across Wright, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington counties. The worst damage which a storm survey estimated winds near 80 mph, produced a six mile long damage path of downed transmission lines near St. Michaels and Rogers. As the storms moved into the western metro area, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, with measured severe wind gusts at both Crystal and Flying Cloud airports. The downtown St. Paul airport also measured a severe wind gust as the storms moved into Ramsey and into Washington county. The Maple Grove hospital had structural damage to their building. Pavers from an upper roof blew off and penetrated a roof below. This caused rain to seep into patient rooms and to the 1st floor imaging and PCC.   There were some issues related to flooded roads in the Minneapolis, St. Paul metropolitan area, but most of the flooded roads were concentrated in poor drainage where rain water had no place to go.    The second and southern storm initially produced several large hail reports, up to 2 inches in diameter from Cosmos to Hutchinson.

Then, isolated storms developed in the afternoon and produced severe hail. During the evening hours Tuesday, a mature squall line developed over the Sandhills. It propagated southeast and into the region beginning around 11:30 p.m. CST. The squall line was at peak intensity as it entered Dawson, Howard, and Valley Counties. It rapidly weakened after 12:30 a.m. CST. However, the remnant outflow continued to produce strong to severe winds through 3 a.m. CST, well after the deep convection had dissipated. Widespread winds between 50 and 60 mph were measured, but peak wind gusts included 61 mph at Grand Island, 63 mph near Oxford, 64 mph at Lexington, and 76 mph at Edison. Tree damage was reported in several locations, with trees blown over and tree limbs snapped off. The last strong wind gust measured was 56 mph at York, at 3:03 a.m. CST. Isolated power outages occurred across the region.  Later in the afternoon, a small cluster of multicell thunderstorms developed over the Sandhills. A few isolated storms managed to develop along the southwest flank of its outflow boundary, though most of them were weak, short-lived, and sub-severe. A single-cell storm, which exhibited multi-cell characteristics at times, dominated the other cells over Custer County. Just after 7 p.m. CST, this storm moved into northwest Buffalo County and produced a few reports of dime to quarter size hail. By 8 p.m. CST, the storm began weakening and then rapidly dissipated over southwest Buffalo County.  The surface map was complex. The thunderstorms that initially spawned the squall line developed between two fronts. A stationary front extended west from the mid-Atlantic region, through the mid-Mississippi Valley into Oklahoma, then northwest into western Kansas and Nebraska. A weak cold front extended from Lake Superior to the northwest tip of Nebraska into Wyoming and Idaho. The afternoon storms formed behind this front which was surging southward. It was located along the Nebraska-Kansas state line by 6 p.m. CST. In the upper levels, the Westerlies were fairly zonal over the northern third of the U.S., with subtropical highs over the Southwest and off the Carolina Coast. A weak shortwave trough was embedded in the Westerlies over the Dakotas Tuesday evening. By Wednesday evening, it had progressed into Minnesota and Iowa, with some slight amplification and more of a cyclonic look between the two highs. Just prior to the arrival of the squall line, surface temperatures were in the upper 60s to lower 70s, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were steep, between 7.5 and 7.9 degrees C/km, resulting in MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. Effectively deep layer shear was less than 25 kts. The MCS was moving out of an area of more favorable shear, resulting in the shear within the cold pool becoming dominant, and the demise of the deep convection. With the isolated hail producer later that evening, temperatures behind the front were in the lower 80s, with dewpoints still in the middle to upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were moist adiabatic. Nevertheless, MLCAPE was between 1500 and 2000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was around 30 kts.",40.3169,-99.6663

Although ground-truth severe verification did not materialize from each of these counties, there were still several reports of wind gusts in the 50-65 MPH range, highlighted by a measured gust of 63 MPH at Glen Elder and estimated 60 MPH at Cawker City. Within the local six-county area, initial development flared up over Osborne County between 4-5 p.m. CDT. During the ensuing few hours, this multicell cluster tracked northeast before largely exiting into south central Nebraska by 7 p.m. CDT. Although there were no additional severe storms, another cluster of non-severe convection brushed up into Mitchell County out of central Kansas a bit later in the evening, and hours later (well after midnight), the weakening remnants of a Nebraska storm complex limped into areas primarily north of Highway 36. Rainfall-wise, most local places affected by the afternoon storms measured anywhere from 0.50-2.00.  Focusing on the meteorological background, mid-upper level forcing was respectable for mid-August as North Central Kansas was positioned downstream from a broad, slow-moving trough edging from the Northern Rockies toward the Dakotas.  At the surface, a very slow-moving/weak cold front gradually worked its way southeastward through the region during the evening/overnight. However, this round of late afternoon severe weather was strongly tied to weak convergence and considerable instability focused along a pre-frontal surface trough stretched from southwest KS into southeast NE. Despite fairly weak deep-layer wind shear only around 30 knots, these storms quickly became severe in an environment featuring at least 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and surface dewpoints well into the low-mid 70s F.",39.5,-98.31

Already by noon CDT, strong thunderstorms were underway in Phillips County along a cold front advancing southeast through the region. Over the course of the next few hours convection increased in coverage and intensity as it marched across most of North Central Kansas, primarily producing sporadic wind damage and brief, torrential rainfall. Along the way, a few of the more notable storm reports included: estimated 70 MPH winds south of Alton accompanied by nickel size hail and over 2 of rain in a short time leading to localized flash flooding; measured severe-criteria wind gusts of 78 MPH in Beloit, 63 MPH at Simpson and 60 MPH near Jewell. Between 3-4 p.m. CDT, the main batch of strong to severe storms steadily departed the local area to the east and southeast, ending the severe weather threat for the day. Shortly thereafter, additional storms briefly flared up over Mitchell County but produced only heavy rain, and the entire six-county area was storm-free for the day by 6:30 p.m. CDT. Rainfall-wise, the majority of this North Central Kansas area tallied between 0.50-2.00, with slightly higher amounts focused within southwestern Phillips, central Osborne and southern and eastern Mitchell counties, where brief flooding issues were most prevalent.   By mid-August standards, the surface cold front that sparked this event was reasonably-strong, featuring gusty north winds in its wake and steadily-falling dewpoints. Just ahead of the front during the early-mid afternoon, surface temperatures climbed into the 80s F with dewpoints into the mid-upper 60s, fostering appreciable mixed-layer CAPE of at least 2000 J/kg. Deep layer wind shear was fairly modest at around 30 knots, resulting in a predominant multicell/quasi-linear storm mode. In the mid-upper levels, the primary instigator was a low-amplitude shortwave trough kicking eastward out of the Central High Plains in quasi-zonal flow aloft, downstream from a stronger disturbance dropping southeast through MT/WY.",39.39,-97.93

Then, isolated storms developed in the afternoon and produced severe hail. During the evening hours Tuesday, a mature squall line developed over the Sandhills. It propagated southeast and into the region beginning around 11:30 p.m. CST. The squall line was at peak intensity as it entered Dawson, Howard, and Valley Counties. It rapidly weakened after 12:30 a.m. CST. However, the remnant outflow continued to produce strong to severe winds through 3 a.m. CST, well after the deep convection had dissipated. Widespread winds between 50 and 60 mph were measured, but peak wind gusts included 61 mph at Grand Island, 63 mph near Oxford, 64 mph at Lexington, and 76 mph at Edison. Tree damage was reported in several locations, with trees blown over and tree limbs snapped off. The last strong wind gust measured was 56 mph at York, at 3:03 a.m. CST. Isolated power outages occurred across the region.  Later in the afternoon, a small cluster of multicell thunderstorms developed over the Sandhills. A few isolated storms managed to develop along the southwest flank of its outflow boundary, though most of them were weak, short-lived, and sub-severe. A single-cell storm, which exhibited multi-cell characteristics at times, dominated the other cells over Custer County. Just after 7 p.m. CST, this storm moved into northwest Buffalo County and produced a few reports of dime to quarter size hail. By 8 p.m. CST, the storm began weakening and then rapidly dissipated over southwest Buffalo County.  The surface map was complex. The thunderstorms that initially spawned the squall line developed between two fronts. A stationary front extended west from the mid-Atlantic region, through the mid-Mississippi Valley into Oklahoma, then northwest into western Kansas and Nebraska. A weak cold front extended from Lake Superior to the northwest tip of Nebraska into Wyoming and Idaho. The afternoon storms formed behind this front which was surging southward. It was located along the Nebraska-Kansas state line by 6 p.m. CST. In the upper levels, the Westerlies were fairly zonal over the northern third of the U.S., with subtropical highs over the Southwest and off the Carolina Coast. A weak shortwave trough was embedded in the Westerlies over the Dakotas Tuesday evening. By Wednesday evening, it had progressed into Minnesota and Iowa, with some slight amplification and more of a cyclonic look between the two highs.

Eventually this storm moved across most of the Twin Cities metro area, with the most damage from northern Hennepin, through Ramsey and southern Washington.    The second storm followed a similar path from west central Minnesota, southeast to just north of the Minnesota River Valley, then across the southern part of the Twin Cities metro area. The two storms merged across southern Minnesota from near Faribault, northeast to Red Wing, and to near Eau Claire Wisconsin. This storm rapidly moved southeast and became a large bow echo that raced across southern Wisconsin, and northern Illinois by Wednesday morning.    The northern storm produced several measured wind gusts in excess of 70 mph across Wright, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington counties. The worst damage which a storm survey estimated winds near 80 mph, produced a six mile long damage path of downed transmission lines near St. Michaels and Rogers. As the storms moved into the western metro area, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, with measured severe wind gusts at both Crystal and Flying Cloud airports. The downtown St. Paul airport also measured a severe wind gust as the storms moved into Ramsey and into Washington county. The Maple Grove hospital had structural damage to their building. Pavers from an upper roof blew off and penetrated a roof below. This caused rain to seep into patient rooms and to the 1st floor imaging and PCC.   There were some issues related to flooded roads in the Minneapolis, St. Paul metropolitan area, but most of the flooded roads were concentrated in poor drainage where rain water had no place to go.    The second and southern storm initially produced several large hail reports, up to 2 inches in diameter from Cosmos to Hutchinson. This storm began to bow out in the southwest suburbs of the Twin Cities near Jordon, Prior Lake and Burnsville and moved southeast. This storm produced two tornadoes, one east of  Faribault, and another west of Goodhue.  During the height of the storm, Xcel Energy reported more than 138,000 customers without power.",44.94,-93.06

656500,9/22/2016 4:14,58,MG,nan,"On the evening of September 20th, a warm front was stretched west to east across southern Minnesota originating from a developing low pressure system across the South Dakota and Nebraska border. The weather pattern, and associated boundaries were nearly stationary through early Thursday morning, September 22nd. The atmosphere was very moist, which was evident in the soundings as near record high Precipitable Water (PWAT) values were noted.    Although the most significant part of this weather event was flooding, some large hail was observed the evening of September 20th, and during the afternoon and evening of Wednesday, September 21st.   The evening of Tuesday, September 20th, an area of thunderstorms formed along and north of the warm front in southern Minnesota. Heavy rain fell in south central Minnesota, especially near Waseca. A Flash Flood Warning was issued for portions of southern Minnesota but no major issues were reported. Ultimately, 2 to 3 inches of rain fell in a rather short period of time near Janesville and Waseca late Tuesday night. This rainfall event, although localized, created very wet antecedent conditions before the main heavy rainfall event developed the evening of Wednesday, September 21st.  The evening and overnight of September 21st-22nd saw much more and widespread heavy rainfall across southern Minnesota. Two areas that were hit the hardest occurred across Hennepin and Anoka counties, in the Twin Cities metro area, and around Mankato, Waseca and Owatonna.   The worst and most significant flash flood event occurred between Greenfield, Corcoran in Hennepin County, eastward to Spring Lake Park, Fridley, Lexington and Lino Lakes in Anoka County. The first heavy rainfall event occurred between 5 PM and 8 PM CST. This event produced between 3 and 6 inches of rainfall in less than 3 hours, with some areas receiving 3 to 4 inches of rain in less than 90 minutes based on local observations. The second event produced an additional 2 to 4 inches after 9 PM CST in the same areas which prompted a small region to have a Flash Flood Emergency issued. Upwards of 7, to nearly 10 inches of rain fell before midnight. Due to this extreme event, there were hundreds of abandoned cars with water reaching the car windows in northwest metro suburbs during the height of the storm. Interstate 94 in the north metro was closed for a period that night. Five private residents had 3-4 feet of water in their basements, and two homes had water completed filled to the top in Maple Grove. In addition to the homes, there were 15 county roads closed at one point around Maple Grove and Brooklyn Park based on reports from the Hennepin County Emergency Management. A small part of Highway 169 near the border of Maple Grove and Brooklyn Park was closed for 4 days due to the runoff from earlier torrential rainfall.    The other flash flood event occurred near Mankato (northeast Blue Earth County) eastward through Waseca and Steele Counties. Thunderstorms that developed Wednesday evening were much more widespread, and trained over the same areas along and north of the front. Rainfall amounts ranged from 4 to 6 inches from Mankato, to Albert Lea, Kenyon and Faribault. The highest 24-hour total ending on the morning of September 22 was 7.64 inches at the U of M Southern Research and Outreach Center in Waseca. This brought the two-day total at that location to 10.16 inches, including the 2.52 inches of rain that fell with the first wave on September 20-21. This is the highest two-day total ever recorded in Waseca.  Due to the ground that was already saturated from earlier torrential rainfall the day before, the flooding situation became extreme, with ongoing areal flooding lasting for  the next several days as the runoff continued.   There were many reports of basements flooded, closed roads and washouts, and standing water in Waseca and other locations as well. There were a few homes in Waseca that were evacuated due to the flood waters. The indoor ice arena in Waseca had six inches of water on the freshly-iced rink. Loon Lake in Waseca rose over its banks and flooded nearby streets in town. The rising waters of Fountain Lake in Albert Lea encroached into town during the day on September 23, detouring Highway 65 (Main Street) near the lake.  According to the emergency manager at least 75 percent of the homes in the Waseca area were damaged by flooding. A line nearly 200 yards long of trucks and cars filled with wet carpets, furniture and waterlogged TVs and appliances was lined up at the City of Waseca debris dump site.   There was major flooding on rivers and creeks across portions of southern Minnesota that lasted for several days beyond the event. The North Fork Zumbro River near Wanamingo reached a record flood stage of 23.38 feet during the morning of 9/22. The previous record was 23.2 feet. Other rivers, and streams that rose significant or crested above flood stage were the Straight, Cannon, Cobb and Le Sueur.   During the height of the flood event, I-694, I-90, and Highway 169 in Minnesota were closed for a time due to high water. Dozens of county roads were also closed near Waseca, Minnesota in south central MN. Many stalled vehicles, flooded basements and a few localized evacuations took place around southern Minnesota.  Reports from the Minnesota Department of Transportation had numerous state roads closed through Thursday, September 22nd as runoff continued. Some of the major roads that were affected by the flood waters in south central Minnesota included; Highways 13, 14, 30, 71, 83, 22, 28, and 15.    Several of the main roads didnt reopen until Friday morning, September 23rd. Plus, a few didnt open until the following week.   In addition to the road closures, several gravel roads experienced erosion.  Within the Blue Earth County Park System, Wildwood Park and the Fort Le Hillier Canoe Landing had been closed.  Several daily rainfall records were broken which included; Waseca at 7.64 inches, 5.15 inches at Wells, 3.70 inches at Zumbrota, and 3.09 inches at Winnebago.   Due to the extreme event, the President of the United States officially declared the significant storm and flooding in September a major disaster. This declaration brought federal and state aid to the following counties: Blue Earth, Freeborn, Goodhue, Le Sueur, Rice, Steele, Waseca, and others in southeast Minnesota.   The widespread flooding caused significant damage to roads, buildings, and infrastructure. According to a preliminary damage report completed in October 2016, officials determined $8.3 million in public infrastructure damage and $10.1 million in estimated individual needs were noted. Over 6,000 homes and businesses were affected by the flood waters across southern Minnesota.",43.68,-93.37

One occurred during the early to mid evening across the southeast Texas Panhandle. Hail up to quarter size was reported in portions of Donley and Collingsworth counties with these storms. A second round of thunderstorms formed in New Mexico as the main storm system moved closer to the area. These thunderstorms moved into the southwest and central Texas Panhandle. Since the air mass over this portion of the area was much drier, storms struggled to intensify and produced little or no lightning.

The worst damage which a storm survey estimated winds near 80 mph, produced a six mile long damage path of downed transmission lines near St. Michaels and Rogers. As the storms moved into the western metro area, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, with measured severe wind gusts at both Crystal and Flying Cloud airports. The downtown St. Paul airport also measured a severe wind gust as the storms moved into Ramsey and into Washington county. The Maple Grove hospital had structural damage to their building. Pavers from an upper roof blew off and penetrated a roof below. This caused rain to seep into patient rooms and to the 1st floor imaging and PCC.   There were some issues related to flooded roads in the Minneapolis, St. Paul metropolitan area, but most of the flooded roads were concentrated in poor drainage where rain water had no place to go.    The second and southern storm initially produced several large hail reports, up to 2 inches in diameter from Cosmos to Hutchinson.

652775,9/16/2016 2:34,59,MG,nan,"Widespread thunderstorms produced a few severe wind gusts and hail, along with heavy rain on this Thursday. The evolution of thunderstorms was complex during this event. Initially, two separate areas of thunderstorms initiated and organized during the late afternoon hours; one was over northeast Nebraska and the other was over northwest Kansas. In the latter location, the increasing number of storms, some of which were splitting-supercells, resulted in the eventual formation of a small bow echo over south central Nebraska by mid- to late-evening. Meanwhile, the storms over northeast Nebraska back-built into south central Nebraska in a linear fashion, intersecting with the developing bow echo comma-head. The first reported severe hail occurred at 5:45 p.m. CST near Holdrege, from an isolated right-moving supercell just after the split. The second report of hail occurred near Sumner and was associated with a left-moving supercell soon after the split. The first report of estimated severe winds occurred in Harlan County around 7:40 p.m. CST, just as the squall line was forming. The subsequent bow echo produced winds a couple other reports of severe winds in Webster and York Counties as well, but there was nothing in the way of damage reported. In fact, this bow echo did not produce severe winds in most locations. Significant rainfall occurred in a few locations, but it was most concentrated where Howard, Merrick, and Nance Counties meet. This is where the stationary line back-built to the western MCS. The heavy rain ended in this area as northern bookend vortex from the bow echo moved through. Rainfall of 3 to 5 inches was common in this area.  These MCSs formed in the warm sector of a weak low pressure system over South Dakota. The western storms formed along and ahead of the cold front, while the eastern storms formed in vicinity of the warm front. In the upper-levels, west-southwest flow was over the region, with a trough from the Northern Rockies back into Utah. A ridge was over the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes. Before the convection moved in, temperatures had cooled into the upper 70s, with dewpoints in the middle to upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were modest, slightly less than 7 deg C/km.

A couple small areas of thunderstorm activity were ongoing over the Nebraska panhandle during the morning. Between 10 a.m. and noon CST, a short squall-line (roughly 2 counties wide) developed and was moving through northeast Colorado and southwest Nebraska. It continued southeastward and entered north central Kansas a little after 3 p.m. CST. In the preceding 30 minutes, it had taken on a bow shape. This bow echo raked north central Kansas between 3 and 5:30 p.m. CST. The apex of the bow tracked across southern Phillips County, along the Smith-Osborne County line into northern Mitchell County. This is where the most intense winds and damage occurred. Winds were measured between 50 and 62 mph along its entire path, with a peak gusts of 68 mph in Beloit and 71 mph at Smith Center. Blown down trees and snapped off branches were reported in a few spots, and a roof was blown off part of a business in Phillipsburg.  The initial storms developed in upslope flow behind a weak cold front that had passed through the area the previous evening. By the time the storms were affecting north central Kansas, the front was along the Kansas-Oklahoma border, and weak high moved into Nebraska. In the upper levels, a broad trough extended across the north central and northeast U.S., while a low amplitude subtropical high was over the West. A weak shortwave trough was over Montana and Wyoming at 6 a.m. CST. By early evening, it had migrated into Minnesota, northwest Iowa, and Nebraska. The pre-convective environment was characterized by temperatures in the 80s, with dewpoints in the upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, resulting in modest MLCAPE of only 900 to 1400 J/kg, and MUCAPE was not much higher. Effectively deep layer shear was around 35 kts.",39.67,-99.6264
638931,6/18/2016 1:33,61,MG,Measured wind gusts of 62 to 68  mph occurred near the Highway 44 corridor in western Kearney County.,"During a June that featured a below-average quantity of severe weather within South Central Nebraska, this late Friday afternoon-night episode ended up being the most widespread round of the month. The majority of severe storms targeted areas west of the Highway 281 corridor, mainly producing damaging winds and locally heavy rainfall/flooding, along with a few reports of large hail. Some of the more noteworthy wind and/or wind damage reports included: a measured 75 MPH gust in the Loomis area with power lines and trees down, measured gusts of 70 MPH near Norman and 68 MPH near Kearney, estimated 70 MPH winds in Beaver City and estimated 60 MPH winds in Lexington with 8-10 inch diameter tree limbs down. While most wind damage occurred between 7-9 p.m. CDT in close proximity to actual severe storms, strong to marginally-severe outflow winds managed to surge 20+ miles out ahead of the primary precipitation cores around sunset. This outflow yielded measured gusts around 50 MPH at the Grand Island and Hastings airports and even toppled a 10-inch diameter tree on the eastern fringe of Hastings. Later in the night, a completely separate, southward-rushing storm complex entered northeastern portions of the local area (counties mainly east of Highway 281 and along/north of Interstate 80) in a weakening state, but still produced northerly outflow of 50+ MPH, including 55 MPH measured at the York airport shortly after 1 a.m. CDT. There were fewer reports of large hail during this event, but stones up to golf ball size were confirmed near Ashton early in the evening, and also near Ord closer to sunset (quarter to ping pong ball size in Ord itself).   Turning to hydrology issues, although they were fairly isolated/localized in nature, there were three bulls eyes of heavy, radar-estimated rainfall of at least 1.50-3.00 that fell in a short time and produced verified flooding. Going in chronological order, the first pocket of heavy rain targeted east-central Sherman County as a nearly-stationary storm parked itself overhead for roughly 2.5 hours between 4:30-7:00 p.m. CDT. This resulted in flooding of Deer Creek, which covered a portion of at least one rural road between Rockville and Ashton for a time. Around the time rain started easing up over Sherman County, additional pockets of short-fused heavy rain focused over portions of central Dawson and west-central Phelps counties mainly between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, resulting in several county road closures in the Cozad/Lexington and Bertrand/Loomis areas. Although there were almost no official gauge totals from the very-heaviest rain zones, Lexington airport tallied 2.56. Outside of these three aforementioned pockets of very heavy rain, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 0.50-1.00 during this event, and hardly even a drop within most central counties along the Highway 281 corridor.  Taking a closer look at timing, the first, isolated storms of the day flared up during the peak heating hours of 3-6 p.m. CDT, primarily within Sherman and Dawson counties. Then, during the ensuing four hours through 10 p.m. CDT, storm coverage greatly increased within the western half of South Central Nebraska, both as a result of new development along local outflow boundaries and also from additional storms expanding northeastward into the area out of southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. After 10 p.m. CDT, the onset of diurnal cooling resulted in a steady weakening/dissipation of the main round of afternoon/evening convection. However, primarily between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 18th, a completely separate southward-tracking storm complex entered mainly northeastern portions of South Central Nebraska in a steadily-weakening state. Through the remainder of the night, scattered weak thunderstorms lingered over eastern portions of the area (especially within the Highway 81 counties), but by sunrise on the 18th nearly all of South Central Nebraska was rain-free. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots), initially limiting the overall magnitude/coverage of severe storms. However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the overall-hottest, most humid days of summer 2016 within South Central Nebraska as temperatures generally topped out 96-100 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada. At the surface, there were no pronounced boundaries of note over the local area, although a somewhat subtle inverted trough extended across Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast.",40.48,-99.09

633778,6/3/2016 22:32,65,MG,Wind (measured by a personal weather station) was accompanied by nickel size hail.,"A narrow, broken line of strong to isolated severe thunderstorms flared up along a cold front over southern portions of South Central Nebraska on this Friday afternoon. Although these storms yielded very few severe weather reports, one of them consisted of a brief landspout tornado in central Adams County. This EF0-rated tornado, which touched down roughly 2.5 miles southwest of Juniata around 4:30 p.m. CDT, tracked only a very short distance but partially ripped the roof from a metal outbuilding along the way. About an hour later, a trained spotter northwest of Red Cloud reported a combination of nickel size hail and wind gusts to 75 MPH (as measured by a personal weather station).   This fairly localized and short-duration severe weather event got underway during peak afternoon heating along a classic, slowly-southeastward-tracking front. Initial development took place between 4:00-4:30 p.m. CDT, consisting of a broken line of convection extending roughly along a line from Minden-Hastings-Giltner. As is often the case, the landspout tornado near Juniata materialized early in storm maturity, just as the initial updrafts were strengthening in the presence of enhanced low-level vorticity along the surface frontal zone. As this broken line headed southeast around 20 MPH, most of it remained sub-severe and even weakened. However, the southwestern flank intensified through western Webster County, producing the aforementioned severe wind gusts before exiting southward into Kansas between 6:00-6:30 p.m. CDT. A short time later, a secondary narrow line of storms popped up over the York County area but remained sub-severe. By 8 p.m. CDT, all of South Central Nebraska found itself storm-free for the remainder of the night. In the mid-upper levels, the main driving force for this event was a broad shortwave trough sinking southeast across the Dakotas into eastern Nebraska over the course of the afternoon and evening. This wave was embedded within strengthening northwesterly flow aloft, with the Central Plains residing on the downstream side of a pronounced western CONUS ridge. At the surface, the aforementioned cold front roughly bisected South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast around the time of storm development, trailing well-southward from a weak low pressure center in eastern North Dakota. Near and ahead of this boundary, modestly-unstable conditions were noted over the local area as temperatures warmed into the mid-80s F and dewpoints averaged in the mid-50s to around 60 F, promoting mixed-layer CAPE up to around 1500 J/kg in the presence of deep-layer wind shear up to 35 knots.",40.1921,-98.6505

638929,6/18/2016 0:55,65,MG,This wind gust was measured 5 miles north of Loomis.,"During a June that featured a below-average quantity of severe weather within South Central Nebraska, this late Friday afternoon-night episode ended up being the most widespread round of the month. The majority of severe storms targeted areas west of the Highway 281 corridor, mainly producing damaging winds and locally heavy rainfall/flooding, along with a few reports of large hail. Some of the more noteworthy wind and/or wind damage reports included: a measured 75 MPH gust in the Loomis area with power lines and trees down, measured gusts of 70 MPH near Norman and 68 MPH near Kearney, estimated 70 MPH winds in Beaver City and estimated 60 MPH winds in Lexington with 8-10 inch diameter tree limbs down. While most wind damage occurred between 7-9 p.m. CDT in close proximity to actual severe storms, strong to marginally-severe outflow winds managed to surge 20+ miles out ahead of the primary precipitation cores around sunset. This outflow yielded measured gusts around 50 MPH at the Grand Island and Hastings airports and even toppled a 10-inch diameter tree on the eastern fringe of Hastings. Later in the night, a completely separate, southward-rushing storm complex entered northeastern portions of the local area (counties mainly east of Highway 281 and along/north of Interstate 80) in a weakening state, but still produced northerly outflow of 50+ MPH, including 55 MPH measured at the York airport shortly after 1 a.m. CDT. There were fewer reports of large hail during this event, but stones up to golf ball size were confirmed near Ashton early in the evening, and also near Ord closer to sunset (quarter to ping pong ball size in Ord itself).   Turning to hydrology issues, although they were fairly isolated/localized in nature, there were three bulls eyes of heavy, radar-estimated rainfall of at least 1.50-3.00 that fell in a short time and produced verified flooding. Going in chronological order, the first pocket of heavy rain targeted east-central Sherman County as a nearly-stationary storm parked itself overhead for roughly 2.5 hours between 4:30-7:00 p.m. CDT. This resulted in flooding of Deer Creek, which covered a portion of at least one rural road between Rockville and Ashton for a time. Around the time rain started easing up over Sherman County, additional pockets of short-fused heavy rain focused over portions of central Dawson and west-central Phelps counties mainly between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, resulting in several county road closures in the Cozad/Lexington and Bertrand/Loomis areas. Although there were almost no official gauge totals from the very-heaviest rain zones, Lexington airport tallied 2.56. Outside of these three aforementioned pockets of very heavy rain, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 0.50-1.00 during this event, and hardly even a drop within most central counties along the Highway 281 corridor.  Taking a closer look at timing, the first, isolated storms of the day flared up during the peak heating hours of 3-6 p.m. CDT, primarily within Sherman and Dawson counties. Then, during the ensuing four hours through 10 p.m. CDT, storm coverage greatly increased within the western half of South Central Nebraska, both as a result of new development along local outflow boundaries and also from additional storms expanding northeastward into the area out of southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. After 10 p.m. CDT, the onset of diurnal cooling resulted in a steady weakening/dissipation of the main round of afternoon/evening convection. However, primarily between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 18th, a completely separate southward-tracking storm complex entered mainly northeastern portions of South Central Nebraska in a steadily-weakening state. Through the remainder of the night, scattered weak thunderstorms lingered over eastern portions of the area (especially within the Highway 81 counties), but by sunrise on the 18th nearly all of South Central Nebraska was rain-free. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots), initially limiting the overall magnitude/coverage of severe storms. However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the overall-hottest, most humid days of summer 2016 within South Central Nebraska as temperatures generally topped out 96-100 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada. At the surface, there were no pronounced boundaries of note over the local area, although a somewhat subtle inverted trough extended across Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast.",40.55,-99.51

641190,7/27/2016 6:27,66,MG,These winds were associated with a gust front from a squall line that passed just to the northeast. Tree limbs were downed and power was out in town.,"A squall line brought wind damage and strong to severe wind gusts to much of south central Nebraska during the very early morning hours on this Wednesday. Then, isolated storms developed in the afternoon and produced severe hail. During the evening hours Tuesday, a mature squall line developed over the Sandhills. It propagated southeast and into the region beginning around 11:30 p.m. CST. The squall line was at peak intensity as it entered Dawson, Howard, and Valley Counties. It rapidly weakened after 12:30 a.m. CST. However, the remnant outflow continued to produce strong to severe winds through 3 a.m. CST, well after the deep convection had dissipated. Widespread winds between 50 and 60 mph were measured, but peak wind gusts included 61 mph at Grand Island, 63 mph near Oxford, 64 mph at Lexington, and 76 mph at Edison. Tree damage was reported in several locations, with trees blown over and tree limbs snapped off. The last strong wind gust measured was 56 mph at York, at 3:03 a.m. CST. Isolated power outages occurred across the region.  Later in the afternoon, a small cluster of multicell thunderstorms developed over the Sandhills. A few isolated storms managed to develop along the southwest flank of its outflow boundary, though most of them were weak, short-lived, and sub-severe. A single-cell storm, which exhibited multi-cell characteristics at times, dominated the other cells over Custer County. Just after 7 p.m. CST, this storm moved into northwest Buffalo County and produced a few reports of dime to quarter size hail. By 8 p.m. CST, the storm began weakening and then rapidly dissipated over southwest Buffalo County.  The surface map was complex. The thunderstorms that initially spawned the squall line developed between two fronts. A stationary front extended west from the mid-Atlantic region, through the mid-Mississippi Valley into Oklahoma, then northwest into western Kansas and Nebraska. A weak cold front extended from Lake Superior to the northwest tip of Nebraska into Wyoming and Idaho. The afternoon storms formed behind this front which was surging southward. It was located along the Nebraska-Kansas state line by 6 p.m. CST. In the upper levels, the Westerlies were fairly zonal over the northern third of the U.S., with subtropical highs over the Southwest and off the Carolina Coast. A weak shortwave trough was embedded in the Westerlies over the Dakotas Tuesday evening. By Wednesday evening, it had progressed into Minnesota and Iowa, with some slight amplification and more of a cyclonic look between the two highs. Just prior to the arrival of the squall line, surface temperatures were in the upper 60s to lower 70s, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were steep, between 7.5 and 7.9 degrees C/km, resulting in MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. Effectively deep layer shear was less than 25 kts. The MCS was moving out of an area of more favorable shear, resulting in the shear within the cold pool becoming dominant, and the demise of the deep convection. With the isolated hail producer later that evening, temperatures behind the front were in the lower 80s, with dewpoints still in the middle to upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were moist adiabatic. Nevertheless, MLCAPE was between 1500 and 2000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was around 30 kts.",40.28,-99.77

Tree damage was reported in Smith Center.,"Widespread severe winds and some wind damage occurred over much of north central Kansas on this Thursday afternoon. A couple small areas of thunderstorm activity were ongoing over the Nebraska panhandle during the morning. Between 10 a.m. and noon CST, a short squall-line (roughly 2 counties wide) developed and was moving through northeast Colorado and southwest Nebraska. It continued southeastward and entered north central Kansas a little after 3 p.m. CST. In the preceding 30 minutes, it had taken on a bow shape. This bow echo raked north central Kansas between 3 and 5:30 p.m. CST. The apex of the bow tracked across southern Phillips County, along the Smith-Osborne County line into northern Mitchell County. This is where the most intense winds and damage occurred. Winds were measured between 50 and 62 mph along its entire path, with a peak gusts of 68 mph in Beloit and 71 mph at Smith Center. Blown down trees and snapped off branches were reported in a few spots, and a roof was blown off part of a business in Phillipsburg.  The initial storms developed in upslope flow behind a weak cold front that had passed through the area the previous evening. By the time the storms were affecting north central Kansas, the front was along the Kansas-Oklahoma border, and weak high moved into Nebraska. In the upper levels, a broad trough extended across the north central and northeast U.S., while a low amplitude subtropical high was over the West. A weak shortwave trough was over Montana and Wyoming at 6 a.m. CST. By early evening, it had migrated into Minnesota, northwest Iowa, and Nebraska. The pre-convective environment was characterized by temperatures in the 80s, with dewpoints in the upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, resulting in modest MLCAPE of only 900 to 1400 J/kg, and MUCAPE was not much higher. Effectively deep layer shear was around 35 kts.",39.75,-98.78

Already by noon CDT, strong thunderstorms were underway in Phillips County along a cold front advancing southeast through the region. Over the course of the next few hours convection increased in coverage and intensity as it marched across most of North Central Kansas, primarily producing sporadic wind damage and brief, torrential rainfall. Along the way, a few of the more notable storm reports included: estimated 70 MPH winds south of Alton accompanied by nickel size hail and over 2 of rain in a short time leading to localized flash flooding; measured severe-criteria wind gusts of 78 MPH in Beloit, 63 MPH at Simpson and 60 MPH near Jewell.
