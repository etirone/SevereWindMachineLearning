The storm continued to produce severe winds as it moved eastward, passing south of Guthrie, and then along U.S. Highway 82 east of the city. A resident at a ranch ten miles east of Guthrie estimated gusts up to 60 mph as the storm passed that location at 13:33. In addition, pea size hail reportedly covered the ground. No damage was reported.","Thunderstorms developed beneath the core of an upper level storm system as it translated eastward over the west Texas South Plains before midday on the 7th.   Some of these storms initiated along a weak pre-existing low-level boundary that was oriented west-northwest to east-southeast over portions of Hockley and Lubbock Counties. With very steep lapse rates and strong low-level instability along this boundary, storm updrafts provided enough stretching along the boundary to result in at least one tornado in eastern Hockley County. The storms then continued eastward producing up to one inch diameter hail over the southern half of Lubbock County.  The same complex of storms then moved eastward through the early afternoon hours. An additional cell strengthened to severe levels in King County and produced severe wind gusts.  West to northwesterly gradient winds increased in the wake of the departing storm system aloft and the convective activity. These winds, possibly enhanced by momentum transfer near weak convective showers, resulted in a period of high winds near Jayton (Kent County).  No damage was reported from any of the severe weather impacts across the west Texas South Plains on the 7th.",33.5646,-100.4905

79913,4/11/2008 2:39,50,MG,nan,"An intense spring storm took shape over the central U.S. during the day on the 10th.  The surface low formed over the southern Rockies the previous night and moved into Kansas during the day, then moved into southwest Iowa  during the evening of the 10th.  The upper level low pressure became nearly stacked by the morning of the 11th.  For the most part, Iowa remained on the cold side of the system through the day.  During the late afternoon, as the low lifted northeast, a warm front extending east out of the low pushed north into the state.  South of the front, temperatures were in the 60s to low 70s with dew point temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s.  The atmosphere became unstable with CAPE in the 500 to 1000 J/kg range by evening across southern Iowa.  A strong low level jet was in place with wind speeds around 60 kts.  With the strong winds, both in the low levels and aloft, the effective shear was quite high in the 40 to 55 kt range.  The LCL was quite low with the rainfall that continued through the day and was around 500 meters during the event.  A fair share of the CAPE was in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere with 300 J/kg available.  This was a classic low top convection case with the upper low and dry line approaching from the southwest.  The freezing level was very low across the CWA, sloping from around 6000 feet in the Omaha, NE area, to 9700 feet in the Davenport, IA area.  Lifted indices were around +4, however on the warm side of the warm front they were in the -2 to -4 C. range.  The warm front surged north rapidly into Iowa during the evening, pushing from the Iowa-Missouri border into central Iowa in about 4 hours.  Thunderstorms initially formed in an arc from northeast Kansas into western Missouri.  The storms lifted north-northeast at 50 to 60 MPH.  Rotation was noted in nearly all of the storms with tornadoes produced by some.  One of the stronger storms was a cyclic tornado producer and moved out of northern Missouri into Wayne and Appanoose Counties.  It continued northeast across Monroe, into Mahaska, and then Poweshiek Counties.  Two small tornadoes touched down in Wayne County.  They were only on the ground briefly and caused no damage as they were in open country.  Wind speeds on these tornadoes were estimated at 75 MPH.  A tornado touched down in Appanoose County near Seymour and produced winds of 90 to 100 mph.  Damage from the tornado started about 1 mile south of the intersection of highway J46 and 105th Avenue in far western Appanoose County.  The tornado moved rapidly northeast producing primarily tree damage across rural countryside.  The tornado hit a residence on the southern side of Highway J46, producing EF1 damage to the house and various outbuildings. In addition, a large utility pole was pulled 4 feet south before listing severely to the north.  The tornado and debris continue for close to another mile before ending. The storm moved north into the Iconium area.  It was observed on southern shore of Rathbun Reservoir before traversing the lake and entering into the Antler Acres Trailer park subdivision.  The tornado produced much roof and soffit damage, as well as window damage to many of the homes.    However, one mobile home was lifted and shifted several feet before tie downs held it in place.  The worst damage was to a mobile home which was flipped on its side after the tie downs were ripped out of the ground.  An additional outbuilding about one quarter of a mile to the northeast was badly damaged as well.  The tornado moved nearly to the Monroe County border before lifting.  It set down again in Mahaska County and moved northeast to the southwest of Oskaloosa.  Scattered damage occurred along its path with damage done to fuel pumps at a gas station in the Oskaloosa area as the parent storm passed.  There was also considerable wind damage in the area caused by the RFD.  The same storm moved into Poweshiek County.  The tornado redeveloped just northeast of Barnes City and moved northeast.  Several power lines were downed along with structural and shingle damage to houses. In addition, storm spotters reported some grain bin damage, and road signs were pulled out of the ground.  One mobile home was ripped from its foundation in the 1900 block of Highway 85.  Another brief touchdown occurred a short time later in Poweshiek County.  In addition to the tornadic storms, several of the storms produced high winds and hail.  The hail was generally no larger than an inch in diameter, with most of it around nickel size.  The largest hail was west of Centerville in Appanoose County where one inch diameter hail fell.  There were several reports of high winds, though much of the damage was relatively minor.  High winds in Oskaloosa caused some roof damage and took down power poles.  Damage was also reported to fuel pumps in Oskaloosa.  In Poweshiek County, two barns were blown down and portions of a roof were peeled off at a farmstead east of Brooklyn.  In addition, siding was torn off of the house and windows were blown out.  These were some of the more substantial reports.  Late in the event, additional thunderstorms formed over northern Missouri.  They produced 58 MPH winds in the Lamoni area.",40.62,-93.94

100009,5/2/2008 6:53,50,MG,nan,"An early morning line of storms developed across south central Kansas. This line of storms, developed into a Bow Echo, which raced northeast at speeds in excess of 50 mph, into the greater Kansas City metropolitan area and surrounding communities, early on the morning of May 2, 2008. The Bow Echo generated hurricane force winds, which brought widespread wind damage, to areas from Olathe Kansas, northeast through Kansas City, to Brookfield in north central Missouri. As the Bow Echo moved through Kansas City, it spun up a couple of tornadoes along the apex, or nose, of its leading edge. One EF3 tornado moved across the north side of Gladstone, while the other EF2 tornado moved through an area just northwest of Liberty. However, most of the damage was due to the strong straight line winds, that were also occurring along the apex of the Bow Echo. Gladstone reported 20 homes destroyed, 280 homes with damage, and 19 businesses damaged. North Kansas City had 4 homes destroyed, and 117 damaged. Independence had 13 homes and two businesses badly damaged. Six people were injured and damage was in the millions of dollars.",39.3,-94.72

Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.

In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.  Lightning struck a house in Ankeny.  The house was set on fire by the strike.",41.58,-92.53

Strong instability developed near these boundaries by mid to late afternoon, with widespread showers and thunderstorms developing. Several thunderstorms became severe, but moved little through the early evening due to weak upper level winds. Jackson county seemed to take the worst of the thunderstorms, with several rounds of hail and strong winds reported. The slow movement of the thunderstorms and very heavy rain also caused some water problems on area roadways, with several closed for a couple of hours. The thunderstorms finally weakened and moved off to the south by the evening hours. Monetary damages were estimated.",34.5212,-99.5879

91636,5/30/2008 6:38,50,MG,Report from a schoolnet site.,"A very unstable airmass moved into Iowa during the day on the 29th as a warm front lifted north into the state during the afternoon.  Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.  Flooding became a significant issue after the heavy rainfall of the previous few days.  Extensive river flooding occurred across the central third of the state.

Exceptional updrafts evident within these storms and high reflectivities through a deep layer within the thunderstorms (70 dbz to nearly 50,000 ft)produced hail up to the size of softballs at several locations across the county warning area.  The stones caused the most damage on the southwest side of the city of Manhattan, where the airport, numerous businesses, and hundreds of vehicles were pummeled with the large stones. Residents noted that it was so dark under the storms, that they needed a flashlight to see. A newspaper interview noted that one resident reported that gravel was shooting ten feet in the air, driven by the large hail. Farm fields across portions of Franklin County also showed extensive damage. Small animals that were unable to seek shelter also fell victim to the hail stones.

Although the atmosphere was summer like in the lower elevations, the upper levels were more typical of April.  A strong upper level low pressure area lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies with a negatively tilted trough of low pressure lifting northeast across the central U.S.  An intense low pressure area developed over northern Kansas and lifted north into southeast North Dakota by the morning of the 6th, with a central Pressure of 984 mb.  During the day on the 5th, the atmosphere was capped with the freezing level rising to 15,600 feet by the evening hours over central Iowa.  A warm front lifted north across Iowa, with temperatures warming into the mid 80s to the south of the front with dewpoint readings in the low 70s.  It became quite unstable by evening with MUCAPE between 2500 and 3000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -5 to -9 C. range.  Considerable shear was available with the effective shear between 40 and 65 kts by evening.  Downdraft CAPE was between 800 and 1400 J/kg across the CWA, with 400 to 500 J/kg of CAPE available in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere.  The airmass became very moist by evening with 1.6 to 1.9 inches of precipitable water available by evening.  The LCL fall to between 750 and 1250 meters.  Thunderstorms erupted to the southwest of Iowa in central Kansas, along the dry line there.  The storms raced northeast into Iowa by sunset.  In spite of the dynamics that were in place, the amount of severe weather was relatively limited.  Hail was limited by the high freezing level and lack of supercellular development.  Several of the storms produced small hail and a few produced high winds.  There were several reports of brief tornado touchdowns, but little in the way of damage was reported for the most part.  The first tornado touched down in Cass County and was only on the ground briefly.  Another tornado touched down in Union County.  The tornado took the roof off of an outbuilding and knocked down some power lines.  The strongest tornado was on the ground for over 18 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The tornado track was over open country for the most part and damaged outbuildings and one house.  Three other tornadoes touched down in Jasper County, causing some moderate damage.  The most significant feature with this event was the flash flooding.  Soil conditions across the state were very saturated.  Any significant rainfall resulted in flash flooding.  A narrow band of heavier rainfall stretched from south central into central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in the Des Moines metro area as the airport recorded 4.15 inches of rainfall for the day, with about 3 inches falling in two hours.  Reports of severe street flooding were received with numerous reports of manhole covers being blown off.  During the event, high winds occurred over the far northwest part of the CWA as the surface low intensified rapidly and the gradient tightened.

Temperatures warmed into the low to mid 90s across southern Iowa along and just south of the boundary.  Dewpoint readings soared into the mid 70s to low 80s by evening.  This resulted in very unstable CAPE values in the 5000 to 5500 J/kg range, and lifted indices of -10 to -13 C. during the evening.  A low level jet of 40 kts set up while the atmosphere showed fairly strong shear, in the 40 to 55 kt range.  There wasnt as much deep moisture as had been present in previous days with 1.3 to 1.6 inches of precipitable water.  The freezing level remained quite high at around 14,600 feet and CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was only 300 to 500 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was considerable however with 1000 to 1500 J/kg available.  The LCL was also higher than it had been the previous day and was between 1500 and 2000 meters.  During the evening, thunderstorms formed rapidly over northern Nebraska and far southern South Dakota to the north of the boundary.  By late evening, additional development took place across Iowa.  For the most part, these storms remained just below severe levels.  One of them produced one and one quarter inch diameter hail over central Iowa however.  The main event was the MCC from Nebraska.  The MCC moved into Iowa after midnight and produced high winds and hail as it moved through.  A portion of the system became a Derecho over west central Iowa and advanced across the state during the early morning hours.  Winds of 60 to 75 MPH were common, with a few gusts estimated as high as 100 MPH in central Iowa.  A radio tower was blown over by the winds in the Dawson area of Dallas County.  Tree damage was very extensive from the winds with local utilities reporting as many as 200,000 homes were without power following the passage of the system.  In Jamaica, in Guthrie County, 50 percent of the trees in town were damaged with 30 trees completely down.  The roof was damaged at the race track there.  The Guthrie County mobile EOC was tossed 150 feet into a field and roads were impassible.  In Polk County, in Ankeny, 20 tO 30 Black Locust trees of 1 to 2 feet in diameter were snapped or uprooted near the intersection of 35th street and Highway 415.  Winds estimated at 100 MPH in Dawson, in Dallas County, caused considerable damage.  Roads were blocked by trees, with heavy equipment required to clear them.  LP tanks were leaking in town as they were thrown about and damaged by trees.  The grain elevator in town was also damaged.  Bulldozers were also required to clear streets of tree damage in Boone County at Madrid.

Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.

The seasons first strong push of deep moisture moved into Iowa on the 25th with surface temperatures warming into the mid 80s and dew points surging into the upper 60s to low 70s.  Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.

Thunderstorms erupted to the southwest of Iowa in central Kansas, along the dry line there.  The storms raced northeast into Iowa by sunset.  In spite of the dynamics that were in place, the amount of severe weather was relatively limited.  Hail was limited by the high freezing level and lack of supercellular development.  Several of the storms produced small hail and a few produced high winds.  There were several reports of brief tornado touchdowns, but little in the way of damage was reported for the most part.  The first tornado touched down in Cass County and was only on the ground briefly.  Another tornado touched down in Union County.  The tornado took the roof off of an outbuilding and knocked down some power lines.  The strongest tornado was on the ground for over 18 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The tornado track was over open country for the most part and damaged outbuildings and one house.  Three other tornadoes touched down in Jasper County, causing some moderate damage.  The most significant feature with this event was the flash flooding.  Soil conditions across the state were very saturated.  Any significant rainfall resulted in flash flooding.  A narrow band of heavier rainfall stretched from south central into central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in the Des Moines metro area as the airport recorded 4.15 inches of rainfall for the day, with about 3 inches falling in two hours.

During the evening, thunderstorms formed rapidly over northern Nebraska and far southern South Dakota to the north of the boundary.  By late evening, additional development took place across Iowa.  For the most part, these storms remained just below severe levels.  One of them produced one and one quarter inch diameter hail over central Iowa however.  The main event was the MCC from Nebraska.  The MCC moved into Iowa after midnight and produced high winds and hail as it moved through.  A portion of the system became a Derecho over west central Iowa and advanced across the state during the early morning hours.  Winds of 60 to 75 MPH were common, with a few gusts estimated as high as 100 MPH in central Iowa.  A radio tower was blown over by the winds in the Dawson area of Dallas County.  Tree damage was very extensive from the winds with local utilities reporting as many as 200,000 homes were without power following the passage of the system.  In Jamaica, in Guthrie County, 50 percent of the trees in town were damaged with 30 trees completely down.  The roof was damaged at the race track there.

The seasons first strong push of deep moisture moved into Iowa on the 25th with surface temperatures warming into the mid 80s and dew points surging into the upper 60s to low 70s.  Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.

92929,6/8/2008 22:52,52,MG,nan,"Low pressure developed over Kansas with a strong southerly flow of very moist air streaming into Iowa ahead of it.  Surface temperatures warmed into the 80s with dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  A semi-stationary front extended northeast from the low, across northern Iowa during the afternoon into the evening hours.  The atmosphere became very unstable with MUCAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range by mid afternoon and lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear was quite high, between 40 and 70 kts.  Downdraft CAPW was between 1000 and 1300 J/kg with cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere around 400 J/kg.  The LCL was in the 750 to 1000 meter range, with the lowest over north central Iowa.  With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.",41.63,-92.32

Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 70s to mid 80s across the state, with dew point readings in the 55 to 60 degree range.  A cold front moved into the state from the northwest as an upper level short wave lifted northeast across the state during the evening.  Most unstable CAPE values were in the 1000-2000 J/kg range by the late afternoon.  There was sufficient shear available with the effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range across the north half of the state.  The LCL was quite high, in the 1250 to 1500 meter range.  Cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere had around 200 J/kg of CAPE available.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 700 to 900 J/kg range as the soundings indicated an inverted V structure.  The freezing level was around 12,000 feet.  Thunderstorms fired in a broken line extending from the far northwest corner of Iowa, southwest into Nebraska.  The storms became severe quite quickly as they advanced east.  Many of the storms produced hail of around one half inch in diameter or so.  Several produced hail of three quarters of an inch to one inch in diameter.  The hail would have likely been larger if not for the lack of significant CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer.  As the line evolved, it became solid from north central into west central Iowa.  Initially, the northern part of the line took on a bow echo configuration and produced high winds across north central into northeast Iowa.  The winds blew over a semi-tractortrailer rig near the 197 mile post on Interstate 35.  The bow echo feature continued east into northeast Iowa.  As the line moved through Bremer County, high winds blew down road signs and caused damage at the Wal-Mart store there.  This feature left an outflow boundary extending east to west across central Iowa.  The boundary provided the focal point for additional thunderstorms, which trained across parts of central into northeast Iowa.  Farther to the west, many of the storms produced hail and some heavy rainfall.  Flooding became a problem with many areas reporting small stream and urban flooding.  Flash flooding, as well as areal flooding, became a problem over Wright and Hardin Counties where 3 to 5 inches of rain fell.  One of the harder hit areas was in Hardin County at Alden where nearly 5 inches of rain was reported in under three hours.

Surface low pressure developed over southeast Kansas and deepened rapidly. Surface winds over Oklahoma also steadily increased, with sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph and wind gusts over 50 mph reported at times. These non-thunderstorm winds caused some minor damage throughout the day. By mid afternoon, the storm system had moved toward the plains, with widespread thunderstorms developing from South Dakota into northern Texas. Over Oklahoma, thunderstorms developed along and east of a dry line that was located near the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle border. The thunderstorms took some time before becoming severe, but due to the degree of instability and wind shear farther to the east, supercell thunderstorms finally emerged. Damaging wind gusts and large hail occurred as the storms moved northeast at 45 to 60 mph. Numerous wind gusts of over 80 mph were reported, with many locations reporting wind damage as the thunderstorms passed. Heavy rainfall also occurred, with some locations receiving 3.50 to 4.50 of rain. Several roadways had to be closed due to water running over them. Monetary damages were estimated.",35.9034,-98.97

Copious amounts of moisture were available that allowed repeated heavy rains.  Additionally, there was sufficient vertical wind shear to allow for the generation of supercell thunderstorms with rotating updrafts that led to seven tornadoes in this part of the state of Wisconsin.  The flooding rains constituted the 2nd round/punch of heavy rains that led to more widespread and severe flash flooding and record-setting river flooding (1st punch was Jun 7-9, 2008).  The axis of heavy rains on June 12th extended from Lafayette County northeast through Dane County to eastern Green Lake County and western Fond du Lac County.  Generally 4 to 6 inches fell in this area, with 1 to 4 inches elsewhere.  The generous rains in June at Milwuakee led to a montly total of 12.27 inches.  This easily broke the record for highest June rainfall total. The previous record was 10.13 inches, set in 1917, and also makes June, 2008, the wettest month ever at Milwaukee.

The airmass became very unstable to the south of the front as surface temperatures warmed into the 85 to 90 degree range, and dewpoints rose into the low to mid 70s.  This produced CAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range and a lifted index of -10 to -15 C.  The atmosphere was weakly sheared with 20 to 25 kts of bulk shear.  The freezing level was relatively low, around to just over 13,000 feet.  A small area of thunderstorms formed over northwest and north central Iowa by the late afternoon and early evening hours.  The storms became more widespread and formed into an MCS, which propagated southeast across the state and became severe.  The storms produced hail, high winds, and some flash flooding.  The primary mode of severe weather with this MCS was hail.  Reports of hail were widespread.  Much of the hail was in the three-quarter to one and one quarter inch range.  There were, however, several reports of large hail.  Three inch diameter hail fell northeast of Madrid in Boone County, with another report of two and one half inch diameter hail about 3 miles southwest of that.  Later on, another two and one half inch hail report was received in Story County.  Much of the larger hail occurred during the early stages of the event with golf ball size hail reported in Story, Dallas, and Marshall Counties as well.  During the late evening hours, golf ball size hail also fell in Polk and Warren Counties as a small area of stronger storms developed within the MCS.  The storms produced gusty winds in most areas as they passed, however much of the wind was below severe levels.  Winds gusted to 60 to 70 MPH during the later part of the severe event in Dallas, Polk and Warren Counties as a beta bow element dropped south across these counties.  Rainfall was very heavy with the storms and did cause some flash flooding.  Water was reported over Highway 17 near the Des Moines River in Dallas County, caused by flash flooding.  Fortunately, the weather had been relatively dry for the previous 2 weeks, so antecedent soil conditions were relatively dry.  Five inches of rain fell west of Polk City in Polk County in a 2 to 3 hour time frame.  There were several reports of rainfall in the 2 to 3 inch range in under three hours.

Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.

During the day on the 5th, the atmosphere was capped with the freezing level rising to 15,600 feet by the evening hours over central Iowa.  A warm front lifted north across Iowa, with temperatures warming into the mid 80s to the south of the front with dewpoint readings in the low 70s.  It became quite unstable by evening with MUCAPE between 2500 and 3000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -5 to -9 C. range.  Considerable shear was available with the effective shear between 40 and 65 kts by evening.  Downdraft CAPE was between 800 and 1400 J/kg across the CWA, with 400 to 500 J/kg of CAPE available in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere.  The airmass became very moist by evening with 1.6 to 1.9 inches of precipitable water available by evening.  The LCL fall to between 750 and 1250 meters.  Thunderstorms erupted to the southwest of Iowa in central Kansas, along the dry line there.  The storms raced northeast into Iowa by sunset.  In spite of the dynamics that were in place, the amount of severe weather was relatively limited.  Hail was limited by the high freezing level and lack of supercellular development.  Several of the storms produced small hail and a few produced high winds.  There were several reports of brief tornado touchdowns, but little in the way of damage was reported for the most part.  The first tornado touched down in Cass County and was only on the ground briefly.  Another tornado touched down in Union County.  The tornado took the roof off of an outbuilding and knocked down some power lines.  The strongest tornado was on the ground for over 18 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The tornado track was over open country for the most part and damaged outbuildings and one house.  Three other tornadoes touched down in Jasper County, causing some moderate damage.  The most significant feature with this event was the flash flooding.  Soil conditions across the state were very saturated.  Any significant rainfall resulted in flash flooding.  A narrow band of heavier rainfall stretched from south central into central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in the Des Moines metro area as the airport recorded 4.15 inches of rainfall for the day, with about 3 inches falling in two hours.  Reports of severe street flooding were received with numerous reports of manhole covers being blown off.  During the event, high winds occurred over the far northwest part of the CWA as the surface low intensified rapidly and the gradient tightened.

The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.",41.11,-92.45

The seasons first strong push of deep moisture moved into Iowa on the 25th with surface temperatures warming into the mid 80s and dew points surging into the upper 60s to low 70s.  Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.

As the warm front passed, temperatures warmed into the lower to mid 80s and dewpoint temperatures climbed into the 65 to 70 degree range.  The whole system was aided by an intense upper level low pressure area that moved from the eastern Rockies into the northern plains.  The combination of the high instability in place, the 2 fronts and the upper level disturbance created conditions that were favorable not only for severe thunderstorms, a few of which were supercells that produced tornadoes, but also areas of very heavy rainfall that produced flash flooding that night and river and stream flooding that lasted a day or two later.",41.78,-96.22
91639,5/30/2008 6:47,56,MG,Report received from the Creston RWIS site.,"A very unstable airmass moved into Iowa during the day on the 29th as a warm front lifted north into the state during the afternoon.  Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.  Flooding became a significant issue after the heavy rainfall of the previous few days.  Extensive river flooding occurred across the central third of the state.

Over Oklahoma, thunderstorms developed along and east of a dry line that was located near the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle border. The thunderstorms took some time before becoming severe, but due to the degree of instability and wind shear farther to the east, supercell thunderstorms finally emerged. Damaging wind gusts and large hail occurred as the storms moved northeast at 45 to 60 mph. Numerous wind gusts of over 80 mph were reported, with many locations reporting wind damage as the thunderstorms passed. Heavy rainfall also occurred, with some locations receiving 3.50 to 4.50 of rain. Several roadways had to be closed due to water running over them. Monetary damages were estimated.",34.23,-98.7425

A strengthening low-level jet and strong moisture advection produced several rounds of thunderstorms during the period in the vicinity of this boundary.  The atmosphere was very moist with precipitable water values around 2 inches.  Low to mid-level wind flow supported training of flood-producing thunderstorms.  A weak cool front pushed through southern Wisconsin late on the 8th/early on the 9th, finally ending the heavy rainfall.  The heavy rain axis for June 7-9th ran from Sauk County southeast to Milwaukee County, where generally 6 to 9 inches fell on a ground that was totally saturated due to record-setting winter snowfalls and a wet April, 2008.  Several locations topped 10 inches, and Watertown (Jefferson Co.) came in with 13.5 inches, 11.35 inches was measured in Oak Creek (Milwaukee Co.), and Elm Grove in Waukesha County picked up 10.8 inches.",42.9705,-88.028

Thunderstorms formed initially over Kansas, then spread northeast into western Iowa.  A wind gust of 65 MPH occurred in Bedford as the storms passed.  Mainly, the storms produced very heavy rainfall. In Taylor County, an inch of rain fell in 30 minutes at Gravity.  For the most part, the storms produced wind gusts of 30 to 45 MPH and pea to marble size hail.  Flash flooding occurred in Crawford County as heavy rains caused the water to rise over the top of U.S. Highway 30.

Copious amounts of moisture were available that allowed repeated heavy rains.  Additionally, there was sufficient vertical wind shear to allow for the generation of supercell thunderstorms with rotating updrafts that led to seven tornadoes in this part of the state of Wisconsin.  The flooding rains constituted the 2nd round/punch of heavy rains that led to more widespread and severe flash flooding and record-setting river flooding (1st punch was Jun 7-9, 2008).  The axis of heavy rains on June 12th extended from Lafayette County northeast through Dane County to eastern Green Lake County and western Fond du Lac County.  Generally 4 to 6 inches fell in this area, with 1 to 4 inches elsewhere.  The generous rains in June at Milwuakee led to a montly total of 12.27 inches.  This easily broke the record for highest June rainfall total. The previous record was 10.13 inches, set in 1917, and also makes June, 2008, the wettest month ever at Milwaukee.

The airmass remained quite unstable in spite of the activity from overnight as unstable air replaced the airmass over the state and reloaded the atmosphere.  CAPE remained in the 4000 to 4500 J/kg range with lifted indices in the -10 to -12 C. range at sunrise.  Shear continued to be modest, around 20 kts.  There was little change in the freezing level overnight, and it remained just over 13,000 feet.  The main mode of severe weather during this event was high winds initially, then more of a transition to flash flooding.  There were several reports of winds of 65 to 75 MPH.  The highest measured wind speed was a 76 MPH wind gust at the Coon Rapids Schoolnet site.  Meanwhile, a severe thunderstorm produced a measured 75 MPH wind gust in Dallas County.  Winds gusted to 70 MPH or greater in both Carroll and Greene Counties.  Elsewhere, reports of 60 to 65 MPH winds were numerous.  Though many of the storms produced hail, there were only a few reports of three-quarter to one inch diameter hail.  Flash flooding became a problem as the storms traversed the same areas that were hit the previous night. Flash flooding was most notable in Warren, Monroe, Polk, and Boone Counties.

A private citizen reportedly measured 98 mph winds on their home weather equipment in far west Omaha.  A storm survey done by the NWS estimated that the more significant damage was caused by straight-line winds which reached speeds of 100 to 115 mph in some areas.  The damage swath started in north central Saunders and south central Dodge counties and ended in southern Pottawattamie and northern Mills counties.  Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along the path of the significant damage along with snapped power and street light poles and scattered house and outbuilding damage.

The cold front reached northwest Iowa by the early morning hours of the 8th, however a shortwave lifted northeast across the state during the afternoon and evening of the 7th.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid and late afternoon hours as temperatures warmed to the upper 80s to mid 90s and dewpoint temperatures warmed to the upper 60s to mid 70s.  CAPE values rose to between 4000 and 6500 J/kg by late afternoon, and lifted indices fell to between -7 and -10 C.  The environment was moderately sheared with 25 to 35 kts of shear available.  The downdraft CAPE was quite high, and was between 800 and 1300 J/kg.  A decent amount of CAPE was available, 300 to 500 J/kg, in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere, however the freezing level was very high.  Freezing levels ranged from 14,500 feet over northern Iowa to 16,000 feet over the south.  With the high freezing level, there was a very deep warm cloud layer with precipitable water values in the 1.6 to 1.8 inch range.  The threat for tornadoes with this system was minimal with LCL values around 1500 meters at the beginning of the event, and 2500 meters by early evening.  Thunderstorms developed over north central into west central Iowa by the mid afternoon.  Very heavy rain fell in north central Iowa where the storms intersected the warm front.  Upwards of 4 inches fell in a 2 hour period, however no flooding was reported.  As the event unfolded it became a high wind event.  The downdraft CAPE was able to be realized with numerous gusts in the 60 to 70 MPH range.  There were numerous reports of tree branches broken and several whole trees toppled.  Winds of 70 MPH hit the Waterloo-Cedar Falls area.  Tree and power line damage was extensive in the area.  High winds in Boone County overturned a semi-tractor trailer.  No injuries were reported however.  Heavy rainfall became a problem, especially after sunset when the line of thunderstorms became stationary over southern Iowa.  The heavy rain over the northern part of the state, such as the 2.44 inches that fell in Clarksville in Butler County, did not cause much in the way of flooding.  Overnight, a large area of thunderstorms remained over the same areas of south central Iowa.  Numerous reports of rain in the 4 to 6 inch range were received in the area with the heaviest rain occurring in the Appanoose and Davis County areas.  The schoolnet site in Bloomfield reported 7.68 inches of rain, while the Centerville Schoolnet site reported 7.58 inches.  A measured rainfall of 6.9 inches was received from southwest of the Bloomfield area for one of the heavier non-automated totals.  Centerville received 6.13 inches from overnight rains as reported by the Cooperative Observer.  Appanoose County had received heavy rainfall the day before, as did many of the surrounding areas.

Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 70s to mid 80s across the state, with dew point readings in the 55 to 60 degree range.  A cold front moved into the state from the northwest as an upper level short wave lifted northeast across the state during the evening.  Most unstable CAPE values were in the 1000-2000 J/kg range by the late afternoon.  There was sufficient shear available with the effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range across the north half of the state.  The LCL was quite high, in the 1250 to 1500 meter range.  Cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere had around 200 J/kg of CAPE available.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 700 to 900 J/kg range as the soundings indicated an inverted V structure.  The freezing level was around 12,000 feet.  Thunderstorms fired in a broken line extending from the far northwest corner of Iowa, southwest into Nebraska.  The storms became severe quite quickly as they advanced east.  Many of the storms produced hail of around one half inch in diameter or so.  Several produced hail of three quarters of an inch to one inch in diameter.  The hail would have likely been larger if not for the lack of significant CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer.  As the line evolved, it became solid from north central into west central Iowa.  Initially, the northern part of the line took on a bow echo configuration and produced high winds across north central into northeast Iowa.  The winds blew over a semi-tractortrailer rig near the 197 mile post on Interstate 35.  The bow echo feature continued east into northeast Iowa.  As the line moved through Bremer County, high winds blew down road signs and caused damage at the Wal-Mart store there.  This feature left an outflow boundary extending east to west across central Iowa.  The boundary provided the focal point for additional thunderstorms, which trained across parts of central into northeast Iowa.  Farther to the west, many of the storms produced hail and some heavy rainfall.  Flooding became a problem with many areas reporting small stream and urban flooding.  Flash flooding, as well as areal flooding, became a problem over Wright and Hardin Counties where 3 to 5 inches of rain fell.  One of the harder hit areas was in Hardin County at Alden where nearly 5 inches of rain was reported in under three hours.  A report of 6.25 inches was received from west of Iowa Falls in Hardin County.  This was over a period of six and one half hours.  Numerous roads were closed in these two counties with water anywhere from 6 to 24 inches deep running across the roads.

Meanwhile, a secondary cold front dropped into the north central  U.S. and stretched from eastern Montana into southern Minnesota.  The upper flow was northwest and quite conducive for MCS development as considerable moisture transport took place over Iowa.  Initially, an area of thunderstorms formed over south central Iowa.  The storms remained below severe limits as they tracked east-southeast out of the CWA.  A strong thunderstorm complex developed over western South Dakota during the night and propagated southeast, along with the upper air northwest flow, into Iowa.  The MCS became linear in nature as it moved out of northwest Iowa into the central sections of the state.  Very heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding in several counties, with urban street flooding along the length of the line.  Rainfall rates of one to two inches in one half hour or less were reported.  A few areas received 2 to 3 inches of rain.

With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.",42.57,-92.16

Later that day as the upper level system worked into the central Dakotas, a cold front pushed across the region.  This helped set off another round of thunderstorms that developed over east central Nebraska by late afternoon.  Isolated small supercell thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front over eastern Nebraska, but they were quickly overtaken by a broken line of larger supercell thunderstorms, some of the heavy precipitation type, that developed along the cold front.

91641,5/30/2008 9:16,59,MG,Reported by a schoolnet site.,"A very unstable airmass moved into Iowa during the day on the 29th as a warm front lifted north into the state during the afternoon.  Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.  Flooding became a significant issue after the heavy rainfall of the previous few days.  Extensive river flooding occurred across the central third of the state.

Available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was between 200 and 400 J/kg.  Thunderstorms erupted by the evening and a cyclic supercell developed over southwest Iowa.  By the time the night was done, three separate supercells took a similar track across southern Iowa.  The LCL was quite low, between 500 and 1000 meters.  Several tornado reports were received from Adams into Clarke Counties.  The storms also produced winds of 60 to 70 MPH in places, with the strongest winds late in the event.  A gust of 77 MPH was recorded in the Pella area.  Winds northwest of Baxter flipped a propane tank.  Hail was limited in size by the freezing level of 13,500 to 14,000 feet.  The exception was during stronger periods of the supercells life.  At on point, golf ball to baseball size hail was reported in Union County.  A cluster of thunderstorms formed over northern Iowa as well.  Severe weather was isolated with this area of storms.  Copious amounts of rain fell with the storms, both the supercells and the cluster across the north.  Flooding became widespread with numerous reports of water over the roads along the track of the supercells, and also over parts of north central into northeast Iowa.  The heaviest rainfall occurred over southwest Iowa, where northwest of Creston picked up nearly 8 inches of rain.  Following the heavy rainfall of the previous night, Iowa Governor Chet Culver declared state disaster areas in both Union and Humboldt Counties.  Seven tornado touchdowns occurred.

The airmass became very unstable to the south of the front as surface temperatures warmed into the 85 to 90 degree range, and dewpoints rose into the low to mid 70s.  This produced CAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range and a lifted index of -10 to -15 C.  The atmosphere was weakly sheared with 20 to 25 kts of bulk shear.  The freezing level was relatively low, around to just over 13,000 feet.  A small area of thunderstorms formed over northwest and north central Iowa by the late afternoon and early evening hours.  The storms became more widespread and formed into an MCS, which propagated southeast across the state and became severe.  The storms produced hail, high winds, and some flash flooding.  The primary mode of severe weather with this MCS was hail.  Reports of hail were widespread.  Much of the hail was in the three-quarter to one and one quarter inch range.  There were, however, several reports of large hail.  Three inch diameter hail fell northeast of Madrid in Boone County, with another report of two and one half inch diameter hail about 3 miles southwest of that.  Later on, another two and one half inch hail report was received in Story County.  Much of the larger hail occurred during the early stages of the event with golf ball size hail reported in Story, Dallas, and Marshall Counties as well.  During the late evening hours, golf ball size hail also fell in Polk and Warren Counties as a small area of stronger storms developed within the MCS.  The storms produced gusty winds in most areas as they passed, however much of the wind was below severe levels.  Winds gusted to 60 to 70 MPH during the later part of the severe event in Dallas, Polk and Warren Counties as a beta bow element dropped south across these counties.  Rainfall was very heavy with the storms and did cause some flash flooding.  Water was reported over Highway 17 near the Des Moines River in Dallas County, caused by flash flooding.  Fortunately, the weather had been relatively dry for the previous 2 weeks, so antecedent soil conditions were relatively dry.  Five inches of rain fell west of Polk City in Polk County in a 2 to 3 hour time frame.  There were several reports of rainfall in the 2 to 3 inch range in under three hours.  Although the system was not a tornadic system, there was one report of a funnel cloud in Grundy County.  Lightning struck a house in Polk County.

Freezing levels ranged from 14,500 feet over northern Iowa to 16,000 feet over the south.  With the high freezing level, there was a very deep warm cloud layer with precipitable water values in the 1.6 to 1.8 inch range.  The threat for tornadoes with this system was minimal with LCL values around 1500 meters at the beginning of the event, and 2500 meters by early evening.  Thunderstorms developed over north central into west central Iowa by the mid afternoon.  Very heavy rain fell in north central Iowa where the storms intersected the warm front.  Upwards of 4 inches fell in a 2 hour period, however no flooding was reported.  As the event unfolded it became a high wind event.  The downdraft CAPE was able to be realized with numerous gusts in the 60 to 70 MPH range.  There were numerous reports of tree branches broken and several whole trees toppled.  Winds of 70 MPH hit the Waterloo-Cedar Falls area.  Tree and power line damage was extensive in the area.  High winds in Boone County overturned a semi-tractor trailer.  No injuries were reported however.  Heavy rainfall became a problem, especially after sunset when the line of thunderstorms became stationary over southern Iowa.  The heavy rain over the northern part of the state, such as the 2.44 inches that fell in Clarksville in Butler County, did not cause much in the way of flooding.  Overnight, a large area of thunderstorms remained over the same areas of south central Iowa.  Numerous reports of rain in the 4 to 6 inch range were received in the area with the heaviest rain occurring in the Appanoose and Davis County areas.  The schoolnet site in Bloomfield reported 7.68 inches of rain, while the Centerville Schoolnet site reported 7.58 inches.  A measured rainfall of 6.9 inches was received from southwest of the Bloomfield area for one of the heavier non-automated totals.  Centerville received 6.13 inches from overnight rains as reported by the Cooperative Observer.  Appanoose County had received heavy rainfall the day before, as did many of the surrounding areas.

Several tornado reports were received from Adams into Clarke Counties.  The storms also produced winds of 60 to 70 MPH in places, with the strongest winds late in the event.  A gust of 77 MPH was recorded in the Pella area.  Winds northwest of Baxter flipped a propane tank.  Hail was limited in size by the freezing level of 13,500 to 14,000 feet.  The exception was during stronger periods of the supercells life.  At on point, golf ball to baseball size hail was reported in Union County.  A cluster of thunderstorms formed over northern Iowa as well.  Severe weather was isolated with this area of storms.  Copious amounts of rain fell with the storms, both the supercells and the cluster across the north.  Flooding became widespread with numerous reports of water over the roads along the track of the supercells, and also over parts of north central into northeast Iowa.  The heaviest rainfall occurred over southwest Iowa, where northwest of Creston picked up nearly 8 inches of rain.  Following the heavy rainfall of the previous night, Iowa Governor Chet Culver declared state disaster areas in both Union and Humboldt Counties.  Seven tornado touchdowns occurred.  Four of them were EF1 in strength and had path lengths ranging from 4 to 11 miles.  Three of the tornadoes touched down in Adams County and four in Union County.  The final tornado in Union County crossed into Clarke County shortly before dissipating.",41.02,-94.36

The seasons first strong push of deep moisture moved into Iowa on the 25th with surface temperatures warming into the mid 80s and dew points surging into the upper 60s to low 70s.  Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.

The atmosphere was very moist with precipitable water values around 2 inches.  Low to mid-level wind flow supported training of flood-producing thunderstorms.  There was sufficient vertical wind shear to allow for supercell development that resulted in 10 tornadoes spinning up in south-central and southeast Wisconsin on June 7th.  A weak cool front pushed through southern Wisconsin late on the 8th/early on the 9th, finally ending the heavy rainfall.  During the evening of June 7th, several roads near STH 89 south of Columbus were washed out.  STH 16 east of Columbus closed on June 8th due to high waters.

Surface temperatures warmed into the 80s with dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  A semi-stationary front extended northeast from the low, across northern Iowa during the afternoon into the evening hours.  The atmosphere became very unstable with MUCAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range by mid afternoon and lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear was quite high, between 40 and 70 kts.  Downdraft CAPW was between 1000 and 1300 J/kg with cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere around 400 J/kg.  The LCL was in the 750 to 1000 meter range, with the lowest over north central Iowa.  With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.",42.49,-92.35

During the evening, thunderstorms formed rapidly over northern Nebraska and far southern South Dakota to the north of the boundary.  By late evening, additional development took place across Iowa.  For the most part, these storms remained just below severe levels.  One of them produced one and one quarter inch diameter hail over central Iowa however.  The main event was the MCC from Nebraska.  The MCC moved into Iowa after midnight and produced high winds and hail as it moved through.  A portion of the system became a Derecho over west central Iowa and advanced across the state during the early morning hours.  Winds of 60 to 75 MPH were common, with a few gusts estimated as high as 100 MPH in central Iowa.  A radio tower was blown over by the winds in the Dawson area of Dallas County.  Tree damage was very extensive from the winds with local utilities reporting as many as 200,000 homes were without power following the passage of the system.  In Jamaica, in Guthrie County, 50 percent of the trees in town were damaged with 30 trees completely down.  The roof was damaged at the race track there.  The Guthrie County mobile EOC was tossed 150 feet into a field and roads were impassible.  In Polk County, in Ankeny, 20 tO 30 Black Locust trees of 1 to 2 feet in diameter were snapped or uprooted near the intersection of 35th street and Highway 415.  Winds estimated at 100 MPH in Dawson, in Dallas County, caused considerable damage.  Roads were blocked by trees, with heavy equipment required to clear them.  LP tanks were leaking in town as they were thrown about and damaged by trees.  The grain elevator in town was also damaged.  Bulldozers were also required to clear streets of tree damage in Boone County at Madrid.  In Polk County, at Mitchellville, the roof was taken off of a modular building at the Mitchellville Correctional Facility.

As the storms moved southeast, they began to tap into warmer, more humid air and rapidly evolve into a line of severe thunderstorms. Widespread damage occurred in a wide swath extending from Long Lake in McPherson County all the way into eastern Grant County and southern Big Stone County in Minnesota.  The most extensive damage was generally found along and near US Highway 12 from Aberdeen to Milbank. Several observing stations in the path of this system measured wind speeds ranging from 70 mph to over 115 mph.  Estimated wind speeds from damage surveys indicated even stronger winds with peak speeds of 120 mph.   Over fifty communities in northeast South Dakota and the surrounding rural areas received minor to major tree and structural damage as straight line winds from 70 to 120 mph raced across the area. Webster and Waubay received the most extensive damage from the storms. Thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted, hundreds of grain bins were damaged or destroyed, hundreds of homes, businesses, and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed along with many power poles and miles of power lines downed.  Many mobile homes, campers, and boats were damaged or destroyed along with many road and business signs. Countless homes, vehicles, and campers were also damaged by fallen trees.  Thousands of acres of crops were also damaged or completely destroyed by the winds and hail. The greatest crop damage occurred in the Roslyn, Grenville, Eden, and Pickeral Lake areas in Marshall and Day counties. Many acres of corn were blown down and not able to come back. The large hail combined with the strong winds also broke out countless windows in homes and vehicles along with damaging the siding on homes. Thousands of people were left without power for up to several days. Large hay bales were moved up to 700 yards by the high winds. A semi was overturned on Highway 12 near Webster, injuring the driver. Near Milbank on Highway 12, two other semis were blown off the road resulting in injuries to both drivers. A State Forestry Specialist said it was one of the worst tree damage events he has ever seen in the Webster area.

No damage was discovered during surveys by Texas Tech University personnel.,"An active round of severe thunderstorms impacted the west Texas South Plains during the late afternoon and evening of the 6th and continued into the early morning of the 7th.   Convection originated along a dryline near the Texas and New Mexico border, as well as near a pre-existing weak frontal boundary stretched west-to-east over the southwestern South Plains.   Many of the thunderstorms were supercellular in nature and produced a variety of severe weather hazards, however, splitting and low precipitation modes domininated. While these storm structures helped to limited the overall tornado threat, instances of large hail were widespread. A cluster of low precipitation supercells produced hail up to four and a half inches in diameter over portions of Lamb County. Reports of damage from very large hail also were received in the Lubbock vicinity (Lubbock County).   A supercell that interacted with the pre-existing surface boundary over the southwestern South Plains did produce a brief and weak tornado that was observed by a research meteorologist.

Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.

The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.

Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.

94048,6/15/2008 7:57,65,MG,Wind gust measured by the Steamboat Rock RWIS site.,"Strong warm air advection took place over Iowa during the overnight hours of the 14th into the morning of the 15th.  A low level jet of about 30 kts set up during the late night hours.  Being it was during the night, much of the convection was elevated, however the lifted index fell to the zero to -3 C. range with about 1000 J/kg of CAPE.  Downdraft CAPE war around 1100 J/kg as the airmass was not saturated.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer was only 200 J/kg, so in spite of the low freezing level, 10,000 to 10,500 feet, hail was not a major player.  The high winds were the primary mode of severe weather.  The LCL height was quite high, around 2000 meters.  In spite of that, a tornado touched down briefly in Humboldt County, causing minor damage.  Funnel clouds were reported in Wright County, however no touchdowns occurred.  Two clusters of storms developed and moved east across northern Iowa.  The two actually followed nearly the same track, giving two rounds of thunderstorms to nearly the same areas.  Numerous reports of high winds were received, many in the 60 to 65 MPH range.

The airmass remained quite unstable in spite of the activity from overnight as unstable air replaced the airmass over the state and reloaded the atmosphere.  CAPE remained in the 4000 to 4500 J/kg range with lifted indices in the -10 to -12 C. range at sunrise.  Shear continued to be modest, around 20 kts.  There was little change in the freezing level overnight, and it remained just over 13,000 feet.  The main mode of severe weather during this event was high winds initially, then more of a transition to flash flooding.  There were several reports of winds of 65 to 75 MPH.  The highest measured wind speed was a 76 MPH wind gust at the Coon Rapids Schoolnet site.  Meanwhile, a severe thunderstorm produced a measured 75 MPH wind gust in Dallas County.  Winds gusted to 70 MPH or greater in both Carroll and Greene Counties.  Elsewhere, reports of 60 to 65 MPH winds were numerous.  Though many of the storms produced hail, there were only a few reports of three-quarter to one inch diameter hail.  Flash flooding became a problem as the storms traversed the same areas that were hit the previous night. Flash flooding was most notable in Warren, Monroe, Polk, and Boone Counties.  Many streets were flooded with water reported anywhere from 8 to 30 inches deep.  A strong high/low couplet developed in the wake of the convection.

The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.

The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.

In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.  Lightning struck a house in Ankeny.  The house was set on fire by the strike.",42.56,-92.4

Three confirmed tornadoes occurred briefly in western Dewey County.  Little or no damage was reported and all three tornadoes were rated EF-0. In addition to the tornadoes, multiple reports of large hail were received over Corson and Dewey Counties, including some to the size of baseballs near the communities of McLaughlin and Isabel.  The large hail broke out many home and vehicle windows and damaged many roofs in Dewey, Corson, and Sully Counties.  Significant wind damage occurred over sections of Sully County.  There were multiple reports of wind gusts in excess of 70 mph, with the most concentrated swath of damaging winds extending from near Sutton Bay, eastward to the city of Onida, then southeast to the community of Harrold.     The storm survey began near Sutton Bay on Lake Oahe, where a wind gust of 92 mph was recorded. The most significant property damage was found further east near the community of Agar where multiple grain bins were either damaged or destroyed.  Nine miles west of Agar, a barn was destroyed and a large pine tree was snapped in half. Winds in this area were estimated to range from 80 to 100 mph.  Near the intersection of Highways 1804 and 175th Street, several Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) electrical transmission towers were completely collapsed.
