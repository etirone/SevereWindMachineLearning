488563,12/22/2013 2:00,50,MG,Straight line winds knocked down trees on County Road 542 in Southern Alcorn County.,A potent upper level disturbance moved out of the East Texas while a surface low pressure system tracked from Arkansas along a stalled front. Moist and unstable air moved into the Mid-South in advance of the stalled front and the developing low pressure system. As a result a line of showers and thunderstorms moved across North Mississippi during the evening hours of December 21st.  Many storms were severe with reports of damaging winds and a few tornadoes.,34.7887,-88.6207
471411,7/24/2013 3:18,50,MG,No damage was reported.,"From late in the afternoon of July 23rd until late that night, extremely powerful severe thunderstorms went on a rampage from Central to South-Central Kansas.  The thunderstorms first developed over Lincoln & Ellsworth counties and quickly evolved into monstrous super cells as they invaded the rest of Central & South-Central Kansas as the evening progressed. Several areas in Central Kansas were bombarded by tennis ball to softball-sized hail. Reno County was hardest hit, where an astonishing 12 reports of tennis ball to softball-sized hail occurred and where winds reached a horrific 80-100 mph along the Reno/Kingman County line.  Initially, the super cells were prolific hail-producers, but as the evening progressed, they evolved into a large squall line that unleashed damaging and, at times, destructive, winds that ranged from 70-100 mph as it tore through South-Central Kansas.",37.15,-95.78
485061,12/22/2013 0:38,50,MG,Trees and power lines were damaged in Owensboro. A barn collapsed near Utica. The peak wind gust at the Owensboro airport was 58 mph. A trained spotter in Utica measured a wind gust to 58 mph.,"A surface low pressure system deepened as it moved northeast across western Tennessee, reaching the Lower Ohio Valley in the evening. A strong, negatively tilted shortwave at 500 mb ejected northeast from the southern Plains, providing strong forcing for ascent. A squall line organized near the Mississippi River and then surged east-northeast in association with the strengthening surface low. Unseasonably warm and moist air advanced across western Kentucky and southwest Indiana ahead of the squall line. Though instability was weak, it was based near the ground. Very strong low-level wind shear supported embedded circulations within the squall line. These resulted in pockets of very damaging winds and an isolated tornado.",37.77,-87.12
452523,5/21/2013 2:32,50,MG,Thunderstorm winds blew down several large tree limbs in Plainview.,"A line of severe storms moved through the region.  There were numerous reports of large hail and damaging winds, as well as a couple of tornadoes and flash flooding.",39.1608,-89.9887
445121,5/29/2013 23:11,50,MG,KDFW measured a wind gust of 58 mph.,"A cluster of Thunderstorms occurred during the afternoon and evening of May 29th.

442356,3/9/2013 0:55,50,MG,"A thunderstorm developed southwest of the city of Hereford (Deaf Smith County) around 6:30 PM CST and moved northeast across the city. As the thunderstorm moved over the city of Hereford (Deaf Smith County), the thunderstorm collapsed and produced an outflow which moved through the city. This outflow was measured to be 58 mph by the West Texas Mesonet site 2 miles west of Hereford (Deaf Smith County). No injuries or damage was reported in association with this thunderstorm.","Conditions across the southern Texas Panhandle became favorable for the initiation of convection during the evening hours of the 8th. An upper level shortwave trough rotated around the base of an upper level closed low as it moved into southwestern Arizona. This shortwave trough would go on to move across the northwestern Texas Panhandle coupling with the synoptic lift also provided by the exit region of the jet stream. On the small scale, instability values were relatively low end ranging from 500 to 1000 J/Kg with deep layer shear values around 45 kt. Given these values the most likely hazards would be hail larger than a quarter and damaging winds higher than 58 mph. Thunderstorms quickly congealed into a broken linear structure and increased in strength as they moved east of the Interstate 27 and Interstate 40 Corridor (Potter and Randall County). At this point damaging wind in excess of 58 mph became the primary severe weather hazard, which was verified by a 66 mph thunderstorm wind gust in Skellytown (Carson County).  By 9:00 PM CST, the upper level shortwave moved sufficiently northeast to greatly diminish the synoptic forcing for these storms. As a result convective coverage began to diminish and no further reports of significant weather were reported.",34.83,-102.43
459333,5/28/2013 21:46,50,MG,Thunderstorms formed along a dryline stretching east-northeastward across Randall and Potter Counties during the afternoon hours of the 28th. These thunderstorms would take a northeast track which allowed them to move over the dryline. This caused the thunderstorms to produce isolated downbursts across the city of Amarillo (Potter and Randall County). The National Weather Service ASOS in Amarillo (Potter County) reported a 58 mph downburst as a thunderstorm moved overhead. The Thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No damage or injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle.   By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.     During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds.   The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams.   What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden’s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars.   The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened. However, before the dissipating the thunderstorm was able to produce quarter size hail in the city of Panhandle (Carson County). The remnants of the supercell proceeded to move to the northeast until dissipating over southern Kansas.",35.22,-101.72

459339,5/28/2013 21:59,50,MG,Thunderstorms formed along a dryline stretching east-northeastward across Randall and Potter Counties during the afternoon hours of the 28th. These thunderstorms would take a northeast track which allowed them to move over the dryline. This caused the thunderstorms to produce isolated downbursts across the city. The KVII Schoolnet site at the Northwest Texas Hospital reported a gust of 58 mph as a thunderstorm moved overhead. The thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No damage or injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle.   By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.     During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds.   The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams.   What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden’s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars.   The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened. However, before the dissipating the thunderstorm was able to produce quarter size hail in the city of Panhandle (Carson County).

Considerable moisture was available with the precipitable water values around 1.7 inches.  The atmosphere was moderately sheared with 35 to 40 kts of shear available.  Thunderstorms developed rapidly around mid day and produced very heavy rainfall, as well as high winds and hail.  Most of the hail was somewhat limited in spite of the relatively low freezing level of  12,600 feet.  The LC was relatively low at 1000 meters, however there were no reports of tornadoes.  Wind and heavy rainfall was the dominant weather type.  Hail was limited to penny size up to 1.5 inches in diameter.  Several of the storms produced 60 to 70 MPH winds, downing numerous trees and power lines.  The most extensive damage was in Butler County.  Winds estimated around 80 MPH caused considerable damage to a containment build and significant structural damage to 18 houses in the town of Greene.  Damage in town was around $500,000.  A band of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall was observed from southwest through central into northeast Iowa.  This caused flash flooding as the rain fell on already saturated soil.  There were numerous roads under water from the flood waters.  In the Waterloo area, the water was deep enough to submerge cars and cause many motorists to stall out and become stranded buy the flood waters.  In the Hudson areas of Black Hawk County, flooding in town occurred as the levy partially failed on the river. Officials in Tama County reported that a bridge was washed out, at a cost of $75,000, and at least $150,000 in damage to secondary roads.  In Grundy County, initial estimates of damage to county secondary roads was at least $170,000.

The vast majority of this activity focused near a weakening cold front within 10 to 20 miles either side of a line extending from near Beaver City-Minden-Grand Island-Silver Creek. A few of the most notable severe weather reports included quarter size hail covering the ground in Edison, ping pong ball size hail in Silver Creek and a measured 60 MPH wind gust at the Aurora airport.   The first, high-based storms of the afternoon flared up in southwestern areas generally between Beaver City and Minden between 3 and 5 pm CDT. These storms were closely tied to the invading cold front, and developed in a deeply mixed environment featuring surface temperatures in the mid-upper 90s F and dewpoints in the mid-50s to around 60. Then between 5-7 pm CDT, storms rapidly expanded into the Grand Island/Aurora vicinity and points north and east, where surface dewpoints averaged a bit higher near a north-south oriented warm front. By 8 pm CDT, the primary round of severe storms had exited east and northeast of the local area. However, even as storms started weakening and moving out of the area between 7-8 pm CDT, strong wind gusts of 54-58 MPH were measured in Adams and Hall counties, likely a result of heat burst activity.

These storms weakened briefly in central Minnesota, before re-intensifying across east central Minnesota, in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities, and quickly caused widespread damaging winds across the metro area.   Widespread fallen trees and power lines occurred from near Maple Plain, eastward to Medina, Plymouth, Medicine Lake, St. Louis Park and much of Minneapolis. In addition, the Twin Cities airport measured a wind gust of 61 mph, with numerous wind gusts from private home wind sensors of 50 to 60 mph across Minneapolis and St. Paul.   At the height of the storm, approximately 500,000 residents were without power according to Xcel Energy. It wasnt until Thursday, June 27th, that all areas in the Twin Cities had their power restored.   These storms moved into west central Wisconsin but continued to produced high winds and large hail.  Severe thunderstorms also developed near Mankato Friday evening, and produced up to golf ball size hail. Another area of severe thunderstorms developed across southwest and west central Minnesota and moved east-southeast across south central Minnesota during the overnight hours.  Due to the severity of this event, 18 Minnesota counties hit by flash flooding and severe storms were declared national disaster by the president of the United States, and were allowed FEMA assisted funds.

Also for the second night in a row, the Ord airport measured a severe wind gust, this time topping out at 67 MPH shortly before 1230 am CDT as a powerful outflow boundary surged nearly 15 miles out ahead of a broken line of storms approaching from the west. The most notable storm of the night, however, was an outflow-dominant supercell that developed on the more-organized south end of the line as it pushed in from southwest Nebraska. The brunt of this storm blasted Gosper County as it entered the local area between 1230-130 am CDT, producing a swath of crop damage mainly in southern portions of the county thanks to the combination of quarter to golf ball size hail, and estimated wind gusts of 60-80 MPH. Although the worst part of the storm quickly weakened as it passed east-northeast into Phelps and Dawson counties, it still yielded quarter size hail and a downed power line east-southeast of Smithfield, and a measured 59 MPH gust roughly halfway between Lexington and Eddyville. By 2 am CDT, all storms had weakened below severe limits, but multiple clusters of sometimes-strong storms persisted through the night across several counties mainly along and north of Highway 6, at times producing hail up to nickel size and wind gusts up to around 50 MPH. The back edge of all thunderstorm activity finally exited the far eastern counties of South Central Nebraska along Highway 81 around 630 am CDT on the 23rd.   Backing up to the very beginning of this event, an isolated strong storm rapidly sprung up as early as 5-6 pm CDT on the 22nd in western Dawson County, but only produced nickel size hail in the Gothenburg area before weakening and fading away. Thereafter, South Central Nebraska experienced a lull of several hours before the aforementioned broken line of severe storms initially raced into the area from the west between 11pm-midnight CDT. In general, the brunt of thunderstorm activity on this night focused near a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented quasi-stationary front/outflow boundary stretched across the heart of Nebraska. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was tied to low-amplitude disturbances passing through modestly strong southwesterly flow, along the periphery of a broad trough anchored by a vigorous Northern Rockies vorticity max. In addition to convergence along the aforementioned surface front, the nocturnal maintenance of storms was augmented warm air advection evident at 850 millibars along a 40-50 knot low level jet.

The first severe storm developed early in the morning in southern Hale County and moved south accompanied by wind gusts of at least 50 to 60 mph. A tractor-trailer traveling southbound on Interstate 27 in Abernathy was toppled by these winds; however, no injuries occurred. Although this storm weakened as it moved south into the city of Lubbock, winds at the Lubbock International Airport still peaked at 56 mph resulting in occasionally thick blowing dust along the gust front. By mid-evening, a lone supercell thunderstorm developed in Deaf Smith County and proceeded to drift southwest into Parmer and Castro Counties.

475228,8/2/2013 2:08,51,MG,nan,"This Thursday evening featured the most significant severe weather event of mid-late summer 2013 within South Central Nebraska, occurring mainly between 6 pm and midnight CDT as a series of multicell storm clusters with a few embedded supercells sank southward through the area, eventually congealing into a forward-propagating mesoscale convective system (MCS). Although nearly the entire 24-county area observed thunderstorm activity, there were two primary corridors of severe storms. In the west, Dawson County bore the brunt of severe weather with reports of quarter to golf ball size hail and estimated wind gusts up to 80 MPH. Just west of Gothenburg, four empty rail cars were blown over, and in Lexington, two empty semi trailers were toppled. Farther east, a more widespread corridor of severe storms initially entered far northern counties such as Valley, Greeley and Nance, before propagating southeast across the eastern Hall, Hamilton and Clay County areas before weakening. North of Interstate 80 most storm reports were marginally severe, consisting of quarter size hail and wind gusts to around 60 MPH, including a measured 59 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island. However, storm mergers resulted in a notable upswing in storm intensity over southern Hamilton and especially Clay County, which was overall hardest-hit from a combination of quarter to golf ball size hail and winds estimated up to 80 MPH. This combo resulted in a significant swath of crop destruction, with radar data and limited reports suggesting that the worst crop damage extended roughly 30 miles from southwestern Hamilton County near Giltner through the Harvard, Clay Center and Edgar areas. Other notable storm reports included an irrigation center pivot blown onto Highway 6 southeast of Inland, along with a farm storage shed destroyed in the same area. Farther south, Edgar suffered significant wind damage, especially to trees but also to some structures. A grain bin that blew onto railroad tracks in Edgar was actually struck by a train, shutting down the tracks for several hours (this was the second significant severe weather event to strike Edgar in recent months, following an EF2 tornado on May 27th). Although a few storms during the evening exhibited radar-indicated rotation, and a funnel cloud was reported northeast of Wolbach shortly before 7 pm CDT, there were no confirmed tornadoes within the area. In addition to hail and wind, various locations received heavy rainfall of 2-4 inches, although flooding issues were held to a minimum. A few of the highest-known measured storm totals featured 3.90 near Cozad and 3.80 near Edgar.   Breaking down event timing, several hours prior to the evening main show, an initial series of strong to marginally severe multicell storms developed southward out of north central Nebraska and skirted far northeast portions of the local area mainly between 8 am-noon CDT. The only report from this early activity was nickel size hail at Spalding. Following a multiple-hour lull, clusters of severe storms again built southward into primarily the northeast quadrant of South Central Nebraska between 6-8 pm CDT, a continuation of activity that initially flared up along the South Dakota border earlier in the afternoon. As these eastern storms started to concentrate near the Interstate 80 corridor around 9 pm CDT, a separate cluster of severe storms including an embedded supercell initiated just northwest of the local area over Custer County and dropped slowly southward into Dawson County between 930-11 pm CDT. During this same 930-11 pm CDT time frame, the eastern storms also intensified as multiple cells including another embedded supercell merged into a southward-surging MCS, creating the swath of Clay County damage before steadily weakening along the Nuckolls-Thayer County line. Over time, both the eastern and western convection joined together along a common outflow, gradually losing intensity and drifting southward through southern portions of the area. All thunderstorm activity finally vacated the entire 24-county area around 5 am CDT on the 2nd.

As these storms propagated/developed southward into the local area, they encountered an unstable air mass featuring most-unstable CAPE values around 2000 J/kg and plenty of low-level moisture, evidenced by surface dewpoints well into the mid-upper 60s F.

The thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No damage or injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle.   By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.     During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds.   The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams.   What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden’s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars.   The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened. However, before the dissipating the thunderstorm was able to produce quarter size hail in the city of Panhandle (Carson County).

This trough provided sufficient synoptic forcing to cause convection to develop along a surface trough moving into the Texas Panhandle from central New Mexico. While midlevel moisture was sufficient for convection to form, there remained a deep dry layer leading to a damaging wind threat. This threat was verified as multiple 58 mph or higher thunderstorm wind gusts were reported from across the southern Texas Panhandle. As the convection moved through the central portion of the Panhandle, a visible decrease in intensity and coverage could be seen in both radar data and satellite imagery. The decrease in intensity was due to the storms moving east of the instability axis, and into a more stable environment.

Wind and heavy rainfall was the dominant weather type.  Hail was limited to penny size up to 1.5 inches in diameter.  Several of the storms produced 60 to 70 MPH winds, downing numerous trees and power lines.  The most extensive damage was in Butler County.  Winds estimated around 80 MPH caused considerable damage to a containment build and significant structural damage to 18 houses in the town of Greene.  Damage in town was around $500,000.  A band of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall was observed from southwest through central into northeast Iowa.  This caused flash flooding as the rain fell on already saturated soil.  There were numerous roads under water from the flood waters.  In the Waterloo area, the water was deep enough to submerge cars and cause many motorists to stall out and become stranded buy the flood waters.  In the Hudson areas of Black Hawk County, flooding in town occurred as the levy partially failed on the river. Officials in Tama County reported that a bridge was washed out, at a cost of $75,000, and at least $150,000 in damage to secondary roads.  In Grundy County, initial estimates of damage to county secondary roads was at least $170,000.  As of the 29th of May, Governor Terry Branstad declared 15 Iowa counties disaster areas due to the storms and flooding.  They included Buena Vista, Cherokee, Butler, Floyd, Grundy, Johnson, Iowa, Jasper, Marshall, Mitchell, Plymouth, Poweshiek, Sioux, Tama, Wapello, and Wright.",41.7607,-93.7391

The vast majority of this activity focused near a weakening cold front within 10 to 20 miles either side of a line extending from near Beaver City-Minden-Grand Island-Silver Creek. A few of the most notable severe weather reports included quarter size hail covering the ground in Edison, ping pong ball size hail in Silver Creek and a measured 60 MPH wind gust at the Aurora airport.   The first, high-based storms of the afternoon flared up in southwestern areas generally between Beaver City and Minden between 3 and 5 pm CDT. These storms were closely tied to the invading cold front, and developed in a deeply mixed environment featuring surface temperatures in the mid-upper 90s F and dewpoints in the mid-50s to around 60. Then between 5-7 pm CDT, storms rapidly expanded into the Grand Island/Aurora vicinity and points north and east, where surface dewpoints averaged a bit higher near a north-south oriented warm front. By 8 pm CDT, the primary round of severe storms had exited east and northeast of the local area. However, even as storms started weakening and moving out of the area between 7-8 pm CDT, strong wind gusts of 54-58 MPH were measured in Adams and Hall counties, likely a result of heat burst activity. During the later evening and overnight hours, additional thunderstorms lingered or moved back into parts of the area, but were non-severe. In addition to convergence along the aforementioned cold front, large-scale forcing for this event was aided by weak shortwave disturbances rippling through modest southwesterly flow, displaced well southeast of a much stronger shortwave trough translating across eastern Montana.

These storms weakened briefly in central Minnesota, before re-intensifying across east central Minnesota, in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities, and quickly caused widespread damaging winds across the metro area.   Widespread fallen trees and power lines occurred from near Maple Plain, eastward to Medina, Plymouth, Medicine Lake, St. Louis Park and much of Minneapolis. In addition, the Twin Cities airport measured a wind gust of 61 mph, with numerous wind gusts from private home wind sensors of 50 to 60 mph across Minneapolis and St. Paul.

460635,6/22/2013 2:50,52,MG,A 60 mph wind gust was measured on the Dawson County and Lincoln County line.,"This late Friday evening kicked off a stretch of four consecutive nights of strong-severe storms within South Central Nebraska. This opening act featured damaging wind gusts of 60-65 MPH along the leading edge of a line of severe thunderstorms across far west-northwest portions of the area, with all severe weather reports confined to western Dawson and Valley counties between 950-1100 pm CDT. A few of the most notable reports included estimated 60 MPH gusts in Gothenburg, measured 63 MPH gusts at the Ord airport, and a machine shed destroyed approximately 11 miles west of Ord. Although severe weather only impacted a small portion of South Central Nebraska, widespread non-severe storms tracked across many areas north of Interstate 80 all night long and even past sunrise on the 22nd. Rainfall totals in most places measured no more than 1-2 inches, although an isolated much-higher amount of 3.60 inches was reported 7.5 miles west-northwest of Genoa.   Severe storms initially flared up in western Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours before tracking east toward northwest portions of South Central Nebraska, generally along and near a weak cold front roughly bisecting Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast. Shortly before entering the local area into western Dawson County, storms organized into a generally north-south oriented squall line, sending severe outflow winds surging out ahead. As the line tracked just outside of the local area across Custer County, the leading edge started to bow out, enhancing damaging gusts as the outflow raced into Valley County between 1030-1100 pm CDT. Shortly thereafter, the outflow surged well-ahead of the main area of storms, diminishing the damaging wind threat by midnight CDT. Large-scale forcing for this event was aided by subtle disturbances passing through the Central Plains in modest southwesterly flow aloft, along the southeast periphery of a broad trough anchored by a Pacific Northwest closed low. In addition to convergence along the aforementioned surface front, the nocturnal upscale growth of storms was aided by the development of a 40-50 knot southerly low level jet evident at 850 millibars.

The initial development of this multicell cluster bubbled up over Rooks County between 10-11 pm CDT on Monday evening the 24th and eventually reached severe levels around midnight CDT as it slid east, producing quarter size hail northeast of Stockton, estimated 60-70 MPH winds in the Alton area, and a measured 60 MPH gust at the Osborne airport. By 1 am CDT on the 25th, storms diminished a bit in intensity, but remained strong enough to produce a measured 51 MPH gust at the Beloit airport as the initial cluster morphed into more of a northwest-southeast line segment across Jewell and Mitchell counties between 2-3 am CDT. By 4 am CDT, the last storms of the night within the local area had exited into northeast Kansas and southern Nebraska.   Large-scale support for this event was provided by a passing, low-amplitude shortwave trough embedded within modest west-southwest flow aloft, along the southern periphery of a broad longwave trough draped through much of the central and northwest United States.

Around 2 p.m. CDT, a lone thunderstorm formed near the South Dakota-Nebraska border and eventually became supercellular. As it moved southeastward toward central Nebraska, other isolated supercells joined. Storm evolution was complex this afternoon, with multiple storm splits and cell mergers. At 4 p.m. CDT, one of the new cells formed in close proximity to the initial storm, along the Holt-Rock county border. This storm took over, increased in size and became the dominant storm. Given its proximity to the initial storm, it is likely that some constructive interference occurred between the two. While all other storms tracked southeast or south-southeastward, this storm tracked nearly due south, entering northern Valley County by 6 p.m. CDT. This storm had a history of producing severe wind and hail, so it is likely that continued as the storm tracked across Valley county. However, due to the sparse population, no severe reports were received until the storm hit the town of Ord. Hail as large as golf balls fell in town and the airport ASOS measured winds of 60 mph. Isolated, but intense, wind damage occurred between Ord and the Valley-Sherman county border. A NWS storm survey estimated winds between 70 and 100 mph. The roof of a home approximately 4 miles east-southeast of Ord was damaged. Roughly 120 square feet of roofing material was removed and blown into the yard, including 60 square feet of roof sheathing. The portion removed was at a gable end where the wind lifted up the outlookers/soffit, taking some of the roof with it. Damage also occurred to crops, a barn, a large storage shed and a center pivot irrigation system. Multiple grain bins were also blown over and/or destroyed. The storm continued south, hugging the Sherman-Howard county line, and still producing hail as large as 1.5 inches in diameter. It then rapidly dissipated over northwestern Hall County.

The core of the thunderstorm collapsed 1 mile east of the city of Canyon (Randall County) causing a 61 mph downburst. This downburst was measured by a trained storm spotter near the West Texas A&M University Event Center.,"A vigorous low pressure system swept across the Great Plains during the early morning hours of the 21st. A shortwave trough rotated around the base of this system and helped initiate showers and thunderstorms over the southern Texas Panhandle. However, the forcing was not sufficient for this convection to overcome the strong nocturnal inversion and tap into the marginal elevated instability. The strong deep layer shear easily toppled developing thunderstorms which led to isolated downbursts as thunderstorms collapsed. The shortwave quickly moved to the east, shifting the favorable environment for development out of the Texas Panhandle by the late morning hours.",34.9783,-101.9054

The outflow allowed thunderstorms to continue moving to the east but no further severe reports were received.,"Scattered thunderstorms developed over the eastern New Mexico Plains during the afternoon hours of the 25th.  These storms developed along a dryline stretching from southern New Mexico to the central Oklahoma Panhandle. The low level convergence along the dryline allowed the storms to overcome low level capping inversions and tap into elevated instability that was in place across the Texas Panhandle. The thunderstorms moved to the east eventually becoming self-sustaining shortly after entering the southwestern Texas Panhandle. While over Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties these storms produced sub-severe hail across both counties. As the storms moved into Potter and Randall Counties, they encountered a more capped environment which caused the main thunderstorm to collapse. The cold pool created by this storm collapsed allowed thunderstorms to persist well into Potter and Randall Counties where reports of sub-severe hail and wind were reported to the National Weather Service in Amarillo (Potter County). A stronger capping inversion over Armstrong and Carson Counties quickly suppressed residual convection.",35.1904,-102.0184

These thunderstorms would take a northeast track which allowed them to move over the dryline. This caused the thunderstorms to produce isolated downbursts across the city. The KVII Schoolnet site at Duke Electric (Randall County) reported a 61 mph gust as a thunderstorm was overhead. The thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No damage or injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle.   By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.     During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds.   The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams.   What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden’s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars.   The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened. However, before the dissipating the thunderstorm was able to produce quarter size hail in the city of Panhandle (Carson County).

These thunderstorms departed into eastern Nebraska by 1 pm CDT. In the wake of the initial storms, several storms, some of which were supercells, formed over Webster and Franklin counties, and congealed into clusters and lifted northeast into Adams and Clay counties. Around 2 pm CDT, hail up to the size of golf balls was reported in and nearby Hastings. As these storm clusters moved north, new isolated supercells formed in surrounding areas, including in their wake.

These thunderstorms would take a northeast track which allowed them to move over the dryline. This caused the thunderstorms to produce isolated downbursts across the city. The National Weather Service ASOS in Amarillo (Potter County) reported a 62 mph gust as a thunderstorm moved over head. The thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No damage or injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle.   By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.     During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds.   The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams.   What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden’s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars.   The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened. However, before the dissipating the thunderstorm was able to produce quarter size hail in the city of Panhandle (Carson County).

Considerable moisture was available with the precipitable water values around 1.7 inches.  The atmosphere was moderately sheared with 35 to 40 kts of shear available.  Thunderstorms developed rapidly around mid day and produced very heavy rainfall, as well as high winds and hail.  Most of the hail was somewhat limited in spite of the relatively low freezing level of  12,600 feet.  The LC was relatively low at 1000 meters, however there were no reports of tornadoes.  Wind and heavy rainfall was the dominant weather type.  Hail was limited to penny size up to 1.5 inches in diameter.  Several of the storms produced 60 to 70 MPH winds, downing numerous trees and power lines.  The most extensive damage was in Butler County.  Winds estimated around 80 MPH caused considerable damage to a containment build and significant structural damage to 18 houses in the town of Greene.  Damage in town was around $500,000.  A band of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall was observed from southwest through central into northeast Iowa.  This caused flash flooding as the rain fell on already saturated soil.  There were numerous roads under water from the flood waters.  In the Waterloo area, the water was deep enough to submerge cars and cause many motorists to stall out and become stranded buy the flood waters.  In the Hudson areas of Black Hawk County, flooding in town occurred as the levy partially failed on the river. Officials in Tama County reported that a bridge was washed out, at a cost of $75,000, and at least $150,000 in damage to secondary roads.  In Grundy County, initial estimates of damage to county secondary roads was at least $170,000.

At the surface, a dryline was positioned along the Eastern Plains of New Mexico during the morning hours before advancing eastward into the Texas Panhandle. By noon, this dryline had advanced to the central Texas Panhandle before stalling and provided a focusing point for convective initiation. Thunderstorms developed in an area of moderate elevated instability across the eastern Texas Panhandle which promoted rapid vertical growth. In the same area, vertical wind shear was ideal for the development of supercells. Along the dryline, discrete supercell thunderstorms developed shortly after the noon hour. These supercells produced 60+ mph gusts and hail up to the size of hen eggs.  As the afternoon progresses discrete supercells progressed to the east and merged into a squall line.

This storm moved to the east across the southern Texas Panhandle. As the storm reached Armstrong County, the thunderstorm encountered an outflow from a line of thunderstorms across the northeastern Texas Panhandle. This caused the thunderstorm to briefly strengthen and produced a 63 mph downburst which was measured by the KVII schoolnet site 15 miles south of Goodnight (Armstrong County). After producing this gust the thunderstorm weakened and moved to the south. This further southern position placed it south of the Texas Panhandle.","Severe weather developed over the Texas Panhandle during the evening hours of the 3rd which continued into the early morning hours of the 4th. The rapid succession of two weak mid-level shortwave troughs across the Central Plains provided the large scale lift needed for storm development.  At the surface, a warm front had moved north across the Southern Plains earlier in the day as a surface trough developed across the New Mexico Eastern Plains. As the first shortwave moved across the western Oklahoma Panhandle, scattered thunderstorms developed across the central and eastern Oklahoma Panhandle. As these thunderstorms persisted into the late evening hours, thunderstorms moved into the northeastern Texas Panhandle, and transitioned from hail producers to damaging wind producers. During this same time the individual thunderstorms merged into a line and moved to the southeast. This line caused several reports of thunderstorm wind damage across the northeastern Texas Panhandle. By 9 PM CST, the first of two shortwaves had moved into eastern Kansas and sent the associated thunderstorms into western Oklahoma.    Shortly after 11 PM CST, the second shortwave moved across southeastern Colorado and caused a redevelopment of thunderstorms across the Texas Panhandle. This second wave of thunderstorms was fueled by two additional factors: the transport of moisture into the Panhandle from the low level jet and a residual surface boundary situated from southwest to northeast across the Texas Panhandle. Scattered thunderstorms across the northeastern Texas Panhandle quickly formed into a line while a discrete thunderstorm developed over Deaf Smith County. Prior to forming into a line across the northeast, scattered thunderstorms across the northeast would initially produce hail but once formed into a line would transition to producing damaging wind. These thunderstorms took a southeast track which took them into western Oklahoma by midnight of the 4th. The discrete thunderstorm over Deaf Smith County slowly intensified as it moved eastward across the southern Texas Panhandle. As it moved over Armstrong County, it encountered an outflow boundary which caused a brief intensification and a shift in the storm track to the south.

CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 600 J/kg.  In the late afternoon hours around 500 J/kg of downdraft CAPE was present, and it increased to around 900 to 1100 J/kg during the evening hours. The shear increased as well with 25 to 40 kts available at the beginning of the event, and 50 to 60 kts by the end.  Precipitable water values increased to 1.2 to 1.5 inches.  The LCL was relatively low, around 1000 meters.  The freezing level was relatively low, around 11,900 feet.  The storms produced heavy rain and large hail initially.  Flash flooding occurred first in Crawford County in western Iowa with over two inches of rainfall in about an hour, causing water to flow over Highway 141.  The event became a wind and hail event for the most part with winds gusting to 60 to 80 MPH across a large part of the CWA and hail up to 3 inches in diameter in Adams County.  The largest hail was northwest of Carbon in Adams County, where 2 to 3 inch diameter hail fell.  Reports indicated enough hail fell to completely cover the ground. Numerous reports of 1.5 inch hail were received.  Three tornadoes touched down in central Iowa. Numerous reports of winds of 60 to 80 MPH were received all along the line of thunderstorms.  High winds blew a semi truck off the highway and blew it over west of Earlham in Madison County.

CAPE rose to around 3000 J/kg with a downdraft CAPE of 900 J/kg, and CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere of 600 to 800 J/kg.  The lifted index fell to -9 C.  Considerable moisture was available with the precipitable water values around 1.7 inches.  The atmosphere was moderately sheared with 35 to 40 kts of shear available.  Thunderstorms developed rapidly around mid day and produced very heavy rainfall, as well as high winds and hail.  Most of the hail was somewhat limited in spite of the relatively low freezing level of  12,600 feet.  The LC was relatively low at 1000 meters, however there were no reports of tornadoes.  Wind and heavy rainfall was the dominant weather type.  Hail was limited to penny size up to 1.5 inches in diameter.  Several of the storms produced 60 to 70 MPH winds, downing numerous trees and power lines.  The most extensive damage was in Butler County.  Winds estimated around 80 MPH caused considerable damage to a containment build and significant structural damage to 18 houses in the town of Greene.  Damage in town was around $500,000.  A band of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall was observed from southwest through central into northeast Iowa.  This caused flash flooding as the rain fell on already saturated soil.  There were numerous roads under water from the flood waters.  In the Waterloo area, the water was deep enough to submerge cars and cause many motorists to stall out and become stranded buy the flood waters.  In the Hudson areas of Black Hawk County, flooding in town occurred as the levy partially failed on the river. Officials in Tama County reported that a bridge was washed out, at a cost of $75,000, and at least $150,000 in damage to secondary roads.  In Grundy County, initial estimates of damage to county secondary roads was at least $170,000.

The KVII Schoolnet site at Duke Electric measured a thunderstorm gust of 64 mph.,"Scattered thunderstorms developed along a southward advancing cold front during the late night hours of the 27th and the early morning hours of the 28th. Thunderstorm development across the Texas Panhandle was heavily dependent on the forcing provided by the front due to the weak deep layer shear and marginally unstable environment in place at the time. Given this environment, long lived severe thunderstorms were unlikely, and the primary hazard would be damaging winds as thunderstorms merged then collapsed. This scenario proved true as a thunderstorm collapsed post-merger over Lipscomb County once the cold front pushed thunderstorms into the northern Texas Panhandle. After this merger, there was a brief two hour window where thunderstorms failed to merge along the southern moving cold front. Around 9 PM CST, a storm merger and collapse over Moore County caused widespread wind damage across the city of Borger (Moore County), and the Borger ASOS reported a 94 mph thunderstorm gust before going offline.

459373,5/28/2013 23:05,56,MG,Thunderstorms formed along a dryline stretching east-northeastward across Randall and Potter Counties during the afternoon hours of the 28th. These thunderstorms would take a northeast track which allowed them to move over the dryline. This caused the thunderstorms to produce isolated downbursts across the city. The KVII Schoolnet site at St. Marys School reported a 64 mph gust while a thunderstorm was overhead. The thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No damage or injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle.   By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.     During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds.   The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams.   What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden’s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars.   The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened. However, before the dissipating the thunderstorm was able to produce quarter size hail in the city of Panhandle (Carson County). The remnants of the supercell proceeded to move to the northeast until dissipating over southern Kansas.",35.2,-101.85

The thunderstorm then began moving to the south-southeast once again, and produced a downburst 8 miles west of Slapout (Beaver County). This downburst was measued by the Slapout (Beaver County) Oklahoma Mesonet site to be 65 mph. The thunderstorm quickly moved out of the county and into the northeastern Texas Panhandle.","Severe weather developed over the eastern Oklahoma Panhandle during the evening hours of the 3rd. The rapid succession of two weak mid-level shortwave troughs across the Central Plains provided the large scale lift needed for storm development.

As the first shortwave moved across the western Oklahoma Panhandle, scattered thunderstorms developed across the central and eastern Oklahoma Panhandle. These thunderstorms would produce a mix of sub-severe and severe size hail. As thunderstorms persisted into the late evening hours, thunderstorms moved into the eastern Oklahoma Panhandle, and transitioned from hail producers to damaging wind producers. During this same time the individual thunderstorms merged into a line and moved to the southeast. This line caused several reports of thunderstorm wind damage across Beaver County.

Between 9 PM and 4 AM CDT, several rounds of multicell storms along with a few embedded supercell structures tracked north to northeast across the area, resulting in multiple reports of severe-criteria hail ranging from quarter to golf ball size and damaging winds of at least 60-70 MPH. Some of the most extensive damage occurred in Kearney around 1 AM CDT, due to measured wind gusts up to 76 MPH and hail up to golf ball size. In addition to considerable tree damage within the city, a mobile home was destroyed and several buildings on the University of Nebraska-Kearney campus sustained damage. This included the university library where a portion of the roof was ripped off, resulting in water damage to over 6,000 books. There were also several reports of severe winds and damage in and near Holdrege between 12-1 AM CDT, including a measured 74 MPH gust at the airport, a semi truck blown over on Highway 6/34 a few miles southwest of town and a large metal outbuilding destroyed a few miles northeast of town. Other severe weather reports during the night included quarter size hail at the Hastings NWS office and golf ball size hail in Phillips. In addition to hail and wind, widespread rainfall of 1-3 inches resulted from multiple storms training over the same general southwest-to-northeast corridor, with most 2+ inch amounts concentrated within 15 miles either side of a line extending from near Holdrege-Cairo-Fullerton. A few observers reported totals in excess of 3 inches, including 3.61 near Rockville and 3.41 near Scotia. Although flooding issues were held to a minimum, water was reported over a road near St. Libory.   The first storms of the evening developed near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor between 9 PM and midnight CDT. Some of these initial storms exhibited low-level rotation on radar, and were likely near-surface based in an environment featuring temperatures in the low-60s and dewpoints in the upper-50s, although no tornadoes were reported. After midnight CDT, storms gradually tended to become more elongated and elevated as they were undercut by the surging cold front, although interactions with this front likely enhanced the damaging winds in the Holdrege and Kearney areas. Around 4 AM CDT, the last severe-warned storm exited the local area eastward out of Polk County, and thereafter only a few weak storms lingered through sunrise. As evidence of the strength of the cold front, 4 AM CDT temperatures across South Central Nebraska ranged from 33 degrees at Ord, to 44 at Hastings, to 66 at Hebron. On the mesoscale, the primary trigger for this long-lasting severe weather episode was pronounced low-to-mid level warm air advection and resultant upglide over the top of the surging surface cold front, which effectively bisected Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast at sunset. After dark, an 850 millibar low level jet ramped up to around 40 knots, resulting in a rapid uptick in convection. Around midnight, most unstable CAPE values averaged around 1000 J/kg in the presence of very strong 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear of 60-70 knots.

Other storm reports featured estimated 70 MPH winds at Gaylord, estimated 70 MPH winds and quarter size hail near Downs, and at least one large tree downed in Osborne and Cawker City. Although rainfall amounts across most of the area averaged 1-2 inches at most, a narrow corridor extending from east-central Smith County across southwestern Jewell and northern Mitchell Counties tallied at least 2-3 inches, and even an unofficial gauge reading of 4.90 inches four miles southwest of Jewell. This resulted in localized minor flooding along the Brown Creek in southern Jewell County and near Solomon Rapids in northern Mitchell County.

475229,8/2/2013 2:57,56,MG,nan,"This Thursday evening featured the most significant severe weather event of mid-late summer 2013 within South Central Nebraska, occurring mainly between 6 pm and midnight CDT as a series of multicell storm clusters with a few embedded supercells sank southward through the area, eventually congealing into a forward-propagating mesoscale convective system (MCS). Although nearly the entire 24-county area observed thunderstorm activity, there were two primary corridors of severe storms. In the west, Dawson County bore the brunt of severe weather with reports of quarter to golf ball size hail and estimated wind gusts up to 80 MPH. Just west of Gothenburg, four empty rail cars were blown over, and in Lexington, two empty semi trailers were toppled. Farther east, a more widespread corridor of severe storms initially entered far northern counties such as Valley, Greeley and Nance, before propagating southeast across the eastern Hall, Hamilton and Clay County areas before weakening. North of Interstate 80 most storm reports were marginally severe, consisting of quarter size hail and wind gusts to around 60 MPH, including a measured 59 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island. However, storm mergers resulted in a notable upswing in storm intensity over southern Hamilton and especially Clay County, which was overall hardest-hit from a combination of quarter to golf ball size hail and winds estimated up to 80 MPH. This combo resulted in a significant swath of crop destruction, with radar data and limited reports suggesting that the worst crop damage extended roughly 30 miles from southwestern Hamilton County near Giltner through the Harvard, Clay Center and Edgar areas. Other notable storm reports included an irrigation center pivot blown onto Highway 6 southeast of Inland, along with a farm storage shed destroyed in the same area. Farther south, Edgar suffered significant wind damage, especially to trees but also to some structures. A grain bin that blew onto railroad tracks in Edgar was actually struck by a train, shutting down the tracks for several hours (this was the second significant severe weather event to strike Edgar in recent months, following an EF2 tornado on May 27th). Although a few storms during the evening exhibited radar-indicated rotation, and a funnel cloud was reported northeast of Wolbach shortly before 7 pm CDT, there were no confirmed tornadoes within the area. In addition to hail and wind, various locations received heavy rainfall of 2-4 inches, although flooding issues were held to a minimum. A few of the highest-known measured storm totals featured 3.90 near Cozad and 3.80 near Edgar.   Breaking down event timing, several hours prior to the evening main show, an initial series of strong to marginally severe multicell storms developed southward out of north central Nebraska and skirted far northeast portions of the local area mainly between 8 am-noon CDT. The only report from this early activity was nickel size hail at Spalding. Following a multiple-hour lull, clusters of severe storms again built southward into primarily the northeast quadrant of South Central Nebraska between 6-8 pm CDT, a continuation of activity that initially flared up along the South Dakota border earlier in the afternoon. As these eastern storms started to concentrate near the Interstate 80 corridor around 9 pm CDT, a separate cluster of severe storms including an embedded supercell initiated just northwest of the local area over Custer County and dropped slowly southward into Dawson County between 930-11 pm CDT. During this same 930-11 pm CDT time frame, the eastern storms also intensified as multiple cells including another embedded supercell merged into a southward-surging MCS, creating the swath of Clay County damage before steadily weakening along the Nuckolls-Thayer County line. Over time, both the eastern and western convection joined together along a common outflow, gradually losing intensity and drifting southward through southern portions of the area. All thunderstorm activity finally vacated the entire 24-county area around 5 am CDT on the 2nd. On the synoptic scale aloft, this was a fairly weakly-forced event, with an absence of notable shortwave troughs within a west-northwest flow regime sandwiched between an upper ridge centered over the southern High Plains and an expansive low centered near Hudson Bay. However, mid-upper flow was seasonably strong over Nebraska, resulting in a favorable severe weather environment with 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear around 40 knots during the evening hours. In the low-levels, convergence along a developing east-west warm front was the primary focus for initial afternoon development across northern Nebraska. As these storms propagated/developed southward into the local area, they encountered an unstable air mass featuring most-unstable CAPE values around 2000 J/kg and plenty of low-level moisture, evidenced by surface dewpoints well into the mid-upper 60s F. The southward propagation of convection was also aided by a southerly, 850 millibar low level jet ramping up to around 40 knots.",41.01,-100.12

The squall line gradually moved to the east with some strong storms and embedded supercells developing in the ArkLaMiss Delta. The supercells produced a tornado in the far northwestern portions of the ArkLaMiss Delta. The tornado began in Chicot County, southeast of Dermott, and tracked through Chicot and Desha counties in Arkansas, before dissipating in Bolivar County Mississippi northwest of Cleveland. As the squall line progressed east through the late afternoon and evening multiple trees and power lines were downed across Mississippi. A 64 mph wind gust was recorded at the Cleveland Municipal Airport. The line of storms weakened later in the evening and finally moved out of the region in the early morning hours of December 22nd.  In addition to the damage from the line of storms, strong gradient winds ahead of the storms caused trees and power lines to fall in Adams, Clarke and Jones counties.

The thunderstorms first developed over Lincoln & Ellsworth counties and quickly evolved into monstrous super cells as they invaded the rest of Central & South-Central Kansas as the evening progressed. Several areas in Central Kansas were bombarded by tennis ball to softball-sized hail. Reno County was hardest hit, where an astonishing 12 reports of tennis ball to softball-sized hail occurred and where winds reached a horrific 80-100 mph along the Reno/Kingman County line.  Initially, the super cells were prolific hail-producers, but as the evening progressed, they evolved into a large squall line that unleashed damaging and, at times, destructive, winds that ranged from 70-100 mph as it tore through South-Central Kansas.",37.62,-97.27

459382,5/28/2013 22:57,57,MG,Thunderstorms formed along a dryline stretching east-northeastward across Randall and Potter Counties during the afternoon hours of the 28th. These thunderstorms would take a northeast track which allowed them to move over the dryline. This caused the thunderstorms to produce isolated downbursts across the city. The KVII Schoolnet site at Duke Electric (Randall County) reported a gust of 66 mph while a thunderstorm was overhead. The thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No damage or injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle.   By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.     During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds.   The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams.   What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden’s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars.   The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened.

As the squall line moved across Texas County, the Oklahoma Mesonet site 2 miles east of Goodwell (Texas County) reported a 66 mph thunderstorm wind gust. The squall line continued to move to the east after producing this gust and exited the panhandle by midnight of the 8th.","The combination of a moderately unstable atmosphere, decent deep layer shear, and the presence of a stalled frontal boundary led to a severe weather outbreak during the evening and overnight hours of the 7th. The 6 PM CST upper air soundings out of Amarillo, Texas and Dodge City, Kansas showed surface based instability between 1700 and 2500 J/kg with deep layer shear around 32 kt across the Oklahoma Panhandle. As daytime heating maximized during the early afternoon discrete thunderstorms began developing across the western Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle. After briefly moving to the north these discrete thunderstorms turn to the right and began moving to the east across the panhandle. These discrete thunderstorms would produce hail across the Oklahoma Panhandle up to the size of baseballs. One discrete thunderstorm over eastern Texas County and western Beaver County developed near enough to the stationary boundary for the additional low level wind shear to help develop a brief tornado. The tornado lasted less than ten minutes and the parent thunderstorms quickly diminished as it moved eastward into Beaver County. By 7 PM CST, discrete thunderstorms over the western Oklahoma Panhandle began forming into a squall line.

At 8:45 PM CST, a rear inflow jet became evident on the lowest radar elevation scan from the NWS 88D in Amarillo (Potter County) over southeastern Carson County. This signature is a prime indicator that strong winds are coming in from behind the storm and caused the reflectivity to take on a bowed appearance. These stronger winds eventually reached the surface and were measured at 66 mph by the KVII Schoolnet site in Skellytown (Carson County).  After moving into Gray and Roberts County, this line of storms diminished in strength and no longer produced any significant weather.","Conditions across the southern Texas Panhandle became favorable for the initiation of convection during the evening hours of the 8th. An upper level shortwave trough rotated around the base of an upper level closed low as it moved into southwestern Arizona. This shortwave trough would go on to move across the northwestern Texas Panhandle coupling with the synoptic lift also provided by the exit region of the jet stream. On the small scale, instability values were relatively low end ranging from 500 to 1000 J/Kg with deep layer shear values around 45 kt. Given these values the most likely hazards would be hail larger than a quarter and damaging winds higher than 58 mph. Thunderstorms quickly congealed into a broken linear structure and increased in strength as they moved east of the Interstate 27 and Interstate 40 Corridor (Potter and Randall County). At this point damaging wind in excess of 58 mph became the primary severe weather hazard, which was verified by a 66 mph thunderstorm wind gust in Skellytown (Carson County).

460629,6/17/2013 1:41,57,MG,A measured wind gust of 66 mph occurred.,"This Sunday evening featured several reports of strong to severe wind of 50-70 MPH, as a fairly compact mesoscale convective system (MCS) tracked southeast across nearly the entire six-county area. The most notable measured gusts at area airports included 66 MPH at Smith Center and 56 MPH near Stockton. Other storm reports featured estimated 70 MPH winds at Gaylord, estimated 70 MPH winds and quarter size hail near Downs, and at least one large tree downed in Osborne and Cawker City. Although rainfall amounts across most of the area averaged 1-2 inches at most, a narrow corridor extending from east-central Smith County across southwestern Jewell and northern Mitchell Counties tallied at least 2-3 inches, and even an unofficial gauge reading of 4.90 inches four miles southwest of Jewell. This resulted in localized minor flooding along the Brown Creek in southern Jewell County and near Solomon Rapids in northern Mitchell County.   This line of storms already had a history of producing strong to severe winds as it dropped southward out of Nebraska into Phillips and Smith counties between 730-830 pm CDT. Between 830-1030 pm CDT, the line became increasingly-organized into a bowing-MCS as it charged southeast. By 11 pm CDT, the most intense storms had pushed south into central Kansas, leaving behind lingering, non-severe convection over parts of North Central Kansas through around 130 am CDT. On the synoptic scale aloft, this event occurred in seasonable quasi-zonal flow containing embedded, low-amplitude shortwave troughs, with northern Kansas displaced south of the strongest upper level flow aligned from the Dakotas to the Great Lakes. At the surface, the primary early-evening feature was a warm front bisecting the area along a line from southwest Nebraska to southeast Kansas, which put North Central Kansas in a low-level east-southeast flow regime. Early evening mesoscale severe weather parameters over the local area featured mixed layer CAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg in the presence of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 30-40 knots.",39.76,-98.79

Law enforcement reported tree damage in Smith Center, including one tree which was knocked down and blocking a driveway.","Around 130am CDT on this early Sunday morning, a 67 MPH wind gust occurred at the Smith Center airport, resulting in at least a few instances of tree damage in town. These strong gusts, likely out of the south-southeast, occurred on the back side of a steadily-weakening line of thunderstorms and might have been associated with a wake low. Although there were no other reports of severe-criteria wind within this six-county portion of North Central Kansas during the night, its likely that fairly widespread gusts of at least 40-50 MPH occurred both along and behind this line of convection. Breaking down event timing, a small cluster of multicell storms first rumbled into Phillips and Rooks counties from the west around 11pm CDT on the 25th...a continuation of scattered activity that had been slowly drifting east from extreme northwest Kansas since mid-afternoon. During the ensuing few hours, this strong multicell cluster evolved into a linear mode as it pushed into Smith and Osborne counties before rapidly dissipating. A small, briefly strong storm redeveloped over Rooks County between 230-330am CDT, but that was pretty much it for the night.   On the large scale aloft, this event occurred under fairly modest quasi-zonal flow, as North Central Kansas remained well-removed from stronger flow associated with broad longwave troughs centered near both the northwest and northeast corners of the United States. However, the presence of subtle, low-amplitude shortwave troughs passing through the flow helped ignite strong to severe convection during the afternoon and evening hours to the west and northwest of the local area, in an environment featuring steep low to mid level lapse rates, around 2500 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE, and around 35 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear. The modest intensification of storms well after nightfall was likely aided by an increasing low level jet evident at 850 millibars.

461952,6/23/2013 5:23,58,MG,A 67 mph wind gust was measured with automated equipment from the ASOS at Evelyn Sharp Field (Ord Airport).,"On this Saturday evening and early Sunday morning, strong to severe thunderstorms tracked into western portions of South Central Nebraska for the second consecutive night. Also for the second night in a row, the Ord airport measured a severe wind gust, this time topping out at 67 MPH shortly before 1230 am CDT as a powerful outflow boundary surged nearly 15 miles out ahead of a broken line of storms approaching from the west. The most notable storm of the night, however, was an outflow-dominant supercell that developed on the more-organized south end of the line as it pushed in from southwest Nebraska. The brunt of this storm blasted Gosper County as it entered the local area between 1230-130 am CDT, producing a swath of crop damage mainly in southern portions of the county thanks to the combination of quarter to golf ball size hail, and estimated wind gusts of 60-80 MPH. Although the worst part of the storm quickly weakened as it passed east-northeast into Phelps and Dawson counties, it still yielded quarter size hail and a downed power line east-southeast of Smithfield, and a measured 59 MPH gust roughly halfway between Lexington and Eddyville. By 2 am CDT, all storms had weakened below severe limits, but multiple clusters of sometimes-strong storms persisted through the night across several counties mainly along and north of Highway 6, at times producing hail up to nickel size and wind gusts up to around 50 MPH. The back edge of all thunderstorm activity finally exited the far eastern counties of South Central Nebraska along Highway 81 around 630 am CDT on the 23rd.   Backing up to the very beginning of this event, an isolated strong storm rapidly sprung up as early as 5-6 pm CDT on the 22nd in western Dawson County, but only produced nickel size hail in the Gothenburg area before weakening and fading away. Thereafter, South Central Nebraska experienced a lull of several hours before the aforementioned broken line of severe storms initially raced into the area from the west between 11pm-midnight CDT. In general, the brunt of thunderstorm activity on this night focused near a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented quasi-stationary front/outflow boundary stretched across the heart of Nebraska. In the mid-upper levels, forcing was tied to low-amplitude disturbances passing through modestly strong southwesterly flow, along the periphery of a broad trough anchored by a vigorous Northern Rockies vorticity max. In addition to convergence along the aforementioned surface front, the nocturnal maintenance of storms was augmented warm air advection evident at 850 millibars along a 40-50 knot low level jet. Mesoscale severe weather parameters around midnight CDT in South Central Nebraska featured most-unstable CAPE around 1500 J/kg in the presence of seasonably strong 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear of 40+ knots.",41.62,-98.95

The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle, as instability values increased across the area. At this time, the combination of a residual cold frontal boundary and the dryline helped to form two landspout tornadoes as thunderstorms developed along the dryline across Beaver County. These tornadoes formed over undeveloped land and produced little damage.

459375,5/28/2013 21:57,60,MG,Thunderstorms formed along a dryline stretching east-northeastward across Randall and Potter Counties during the afternoon hours of the 28th. These thunderstorms would take a northeast track which allowed them to move over the dryline. This caused the thunderstorms to produce isolated downbursts across the city. The KVII schoolnet site at Midway Alternative High School (Randall County) reported a 69 mph gust while a thunderstorm was overhead. The thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No damage or injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle.   By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.     During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds.   The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams.   What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden’s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars.   The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened. However, before the dissipating the thunderstorm was able to produce quarter size hail in the city of Panhandle (Carson County). The remnants of the supercell proceeded to move to the northeast until dissipating over southern Kansas.",35.07,-101.9

Thunderstorm development across the Texas Panhandle was heavily dependent on the forcing provided by the front due to the weak deep layer shear and marginally unstable environment in place at the time. Given this environment, long lived severe thunderstorms were unlikely, and the primary hazard would be damaging winds as thunderstorms merged then collapsed. This scenario proved true as a thunderstorm collapsed post-merger over Lipscomb County once the cold front pushed thunderstorms into the northern Texas Panhandle. After this merger, there was a brief two hour window where thunderstorms failed to merge along the southern moving cold front. Around 9 PM CST, a storm merger and collapse over Moore County caused widespread wind damage across the city of Borger (Moore County), and the Borger ASOS reported a 94 mph thunderstorm gust before going offline.

445598,4/9/2013 5:35,64,MG,nan,"For roughly seven hours on this Monday night and early Tuesday morning, the first widespread severe thunderstorm event of 2013 impacted mainly the northwest two-thirds of the 24-county area, largely focused northwest of a line from Alma-Hastings-Osceola along a very strong cold front advancing southeast through the region. Between 9 PM and 4 AM CDT, several rounds of multicell storms along with a few embedded supercell structures tracked north to northeast across the area, resulting in multiple reports of severe-criteria hail ranging from quarter to golf ball size and damaging winds of at least 60-70 MPH. Some of the most extensive damage occurred in Kearney around 1 AM CDT, due to measured wind gusts up to 76 MPH and hail up to golf ball size. In addition to considerable tree damage within the city, a mobile home was destroyed and several buildings on the University of Nebraska-Kearney campus sustained damage. This included the university library where a portion of the roof was ripped off, resulting in water damage to over 6,000 books. There were also several reports of severe winds and damage in and near Holdrege between 12-1 AM CDT, including a measured 74 MPH gust at the airport, a semi truck blown over on Highway 6/34 a few miles southwest of town and a large metal outbuilding destroyed a few miles northeast of town. Other severe weather reports during the night included quarter size hail at the Hastings NWS office and golf ball size hail in Phillips. In addition to hail and wind, widespread rainfall of 1-3 inches resulted from multiple storms training over the same general southwest-to-northeast corridor, with most 2+ inch amounts concentrated within 15 miles either side of a line extending from near Holdrege-Cairo-Fullerton. A few observers reported totals in excess of 3 inches, including 3.61 near Rockville and 3.41 near Scotia. Although flooding issues were held to a minimum, water was reported over a road near St. Libory.   The first storms of the evening developed near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor between 9 PM and midnight CDT. Some of these initial storms exhibited low-level rotation on radar, and were likely near-surface based in an environment featuring temperatures in the low-60s and dewpoints in the upper-50s, although no tornadoes were reported. After midnight CDT, storms gradually tended to become more elongated and elevated as they were undercut by the surging cold front, although interactions with this front likely enhanced the damaging winds in the Holdrege and Kearney areas. Around 4 AM CDT, the last severe-warned storm exited the local area eastward out of Polk County, and thereafter only a few weak storms lingered through sunrise. As evidence of the strength of the cold front, 4 AM CDT temperatures across South Central Nebraska ranged from 33 degrees at Ord, to 44 at Hastings, to 66 at Hebron. On the mesoscale, the primary trigger for this long-lasting severe weather episode was pronounced low-to-mid level warm air advection and resultant upglide over the top of the surging surface cold front, which effectively bisected Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast at sunset. After dark, an 850 millibar low level jet ramped up to around 40 knots, resulting in a rapid uptick in convection. Around midnight, most unstable CAPE values averaged around 1000 J/kg in the presence of very strong 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear of 60-70 knots. On the synoptic scale, this event occurred downstream from an expansive, highly-amplified mid level trough centered near the Four Corners, and in the presence of low-amplitude shortwave troughs ejecting northeast from the parent system into the Central Plains on strengthening southwesterly flow.",40.45,-99.33

The second round of storms produced additional wind damage across primarily Winona County later that evening. In addition, the heavy rain from these repeated storms caused flash flooding to occur near Le Roy and Adams (Mower County) as water from streams flowed over several roads that prompted sandbagging.  Other flash flooding near Rose Creek (Mower County) caused significant flooding at a campground.",43.97,-91.87
450256,5/28/2013 0:16,64,MG,nan,"This Monday, also Memorial Day, was one of the more widespread severe weather events of spring 2013 over South Central Nebraska. The first storms developed over Phelps and Harlan counties around 4:30 pm CDT, and they formed as a short line segment of supercells that exhibited multicell characteristics. Several cell splits occurred during the following two hours, each of which headed north of Interstate 80 and then weakened. The storms that comprised the original line segment continued to advance eastward, remaining south of Interstate 80. After about 7 pm CDT, they transitioned to a dominant multicell mode in the form of a large cluster. The initial storms produced the most hail, including the strongest of the left split supercells of this event, which produced hail as far north as Buffalo county. The largest hail reported was the size of golf balls. As the thunderstorm mode transitioned to multicellular, damaging winds became the primary severe weather threat. Several locations, from Kearney county east to Fillmore county, measured winds in excess of 70 mph. The highest wind measured was 78 mph near Davenport. However, damage surveys suggested winds were as high as 90 mph. Trees and power lines were knocked down, several grain bins were damaged or destroyed and irrigation pivots were overturned. An EF-2 tornado was confirmed in southern Clay County, affecting the town of Edgar. This non-supercellular tornado formed at the leading edge of the line, just after a strong surge of downdraft winds within the line.  With the 8 am CDT Severe Weather Outlook, the Storm Prediction Center upgraded South Central Nebraska, south of Highway 6, to a moderate risk for severe thunderstorms. A weak short-wave trough was approaching the region, embedded within a broad upper-level trough, over the western United States. A quasi-stationary front, oriented in an east-west fashion, extended across Nebraska. During the early morning hours, a mesoscale convective system tracked through eastern Nebraska southeastward into Missouri. This MCS laid down an outflow boundary that extended across northern Kansas, to a lee-side low. It was to the north of this outflow boundary that storms initiated. At the time of initial thunderstorm development, temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s south of the front, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. This resulted in a moderately unstable atmosphere, with MLCAPE between 2000 and 3000 J/kg.

An electrical utility company stated that the number and severity of power outages in Lubbock alone had not been this extensive since the city was struck by the 1970 F5 tornado. In the wake of these destructive storms, high winds with frequent gusts of 50 to 70 mph were noted over much of the South Plains for up to an hour in duration. Total damages from this storm could exceed $500 million.",33.5221,-102.37
445600,4/9/2013 5:54,66,MG,This gust was measured from a home weather station.,"For roughly seven hours on this Monday night and early Tuesday morning, the first widespread severe thunderstorm event of 2013 impacted mainly the northwest two-thirds of the 24-county area, largely focused northwest of a line from Alma-Hastings-Osceola along a very strong cold front advancing southeast through the region. Between 9 PM and 4 AM CDT, several rounds of multicell storms along with a few embedded supercell structures tracked north to northeast across the area, resulting in multiple reports of severe-criteria hail ranging from quarter to golf ball size and damaging winds of at least 60-70 MPH. Some of the most extensive damage occurred in Kearney around 1 AM CDT, due to measured wind gusts up to 76 MPH and hail up to golf ball size. In addition to considerable tree damage within the city, a mobile home was destroyed and several buildings on the University of Nebraska-Kearney campus sustained damage. This included the university library where a portion of the roof was ripped off, resulting in water damage to over 6,000 books. There were also several reports of severe winds and damage in and near Holdrege between 12-1 AM CDT, including a measured 74 MPH gust at the airport, a semi truck blown over on Highway 6/34 a few miles southwest of town and a large metal outbuilding destroyed a few miles northeast of town. Other severe weather reports during the night included quarter size hail at the Hastings NWS office and golf ball size hail in Phillips. In addition to hail and wind, widespread rainfall of 1-3 inches resulted from multiple storms training over the same general southwest-to-northeast corridor, with most 2+ inch amounts concentrated within 15 miles either side of a line extending from near Holdrege-Cairo-Fullerton. A few observers reported totals in excess of 3 inches, including 3.61 near Rockville and 3.41 near Scotia. Although flooding issues were held to a minimum, water was reported over a road near St. Libory.   The first storms of the evening developed near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor between 9 PM and midnight CDT. Some of these initial storms exhibited low-level rotation on radar, and were likely near-surface based in an environment featuring temperatures in the low-60s and dewpoints in the upper-50s, although no tornadoes were reported. After midnight CDT, storms gradually tended to become more elongated and elevated as they were undercut by the surging cold front, although interactions with this front likely enhanced the damaging winds in the Holdrege and Kearney areas. Around 4 AM CDT, the last severe-warned storm exited the local area eastward out of Polk County, and thereafter only a few weak storms lingered through sunrise. As evidence of the strength of the cold front, 4 AM CDT temperatures across South Central Nebraska ranged from 33 degrees at Ord, to 44 at Hastings, to 66 at Hebron. On the mesoscale, the primary trigger for this long-lasting severe weather episode was pronounced low-to-mid level warm air advection and resultant upglide over the top of the surging surface cold front, which effectively bisected Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast at sunset. After dark, an 850 millibar low level jet ramped up to around 40 knots, resulting in a rapid uptick in convection. Around midnight, most unstable CAPE values averaged around 1000 J/kg in the presence of very strong 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear of 60-70 knots. On the synoptic scale, this event occurred downstream from an expansive, highly-amplified mid level trough centered near the Four Corners, and in the presence of low-amplitude shortwave troughs ejecting northeast from the parent system into the Central Plains on strengthening southwesterly flow.",40.7,-99.08

Temperatures were in the 80s with dewpoints around 70 with a mid level speed maximum rotating around the base of a developing upper low in the Plains states. This increased the deep layer shear during the afternoon and evening hours.  Some of the storms produced golf to baseball size hail and 70 to 80 mph winds.  A trained spotter reported baseball size hail knocked out sky lights at the Walmart store in northeast Keokuk. Golfball to baseball size hail was reported on the north end of the city, with nickel to quarter size hail on the south end of the city.  A downburst produced wind damage in Benton county from the county line 3.5 miles southeast of Blairstown to 2.8 miles southeast of Shellsburg. There was a mile wide swath of near continuous damage to farm outbuildings, tree branches and some power poles. The greatest damage was from 3 miles south of Newhall, where a machine shed and garage were completely destroyed, to about 3 miles northwest of Atkins, where significant damage occurred to outbuildings.

Warm moist air was returning to eastern Nebraska as a warm front moved north into the area. Temperatures climbed into the 80s and dew points increased into the 60s by late afternoon over central Nebraska. This led to increasing instability, and eventually scattered thunderstorms by early evening. Thunderstorms initially developed over far northeast Nebraska during the evening hours, but as more thunderstorms moved into northeast Nebraska late in the evening, a forward propagating complex developed and moved southeast across eastern Nebraska eventually exiting into northeast Kansas and southwest Iowa. Initially isolated large hail fell, but as the line of thunderstorms developed, sporadic wind damage was produced over parts of northeast and east central Nebraska.",41.44,-96.49

The line continued moving eastward across the county after producing this downburst, and no injuries were reported in association to this damage.","A weak mid-level trough of low pressure coupled with moderately unstable conditions across the Texas Panhandle during the evening hours of the 8th to bring severe weather. The Texas Panhandle saw both discrete thunderstorms and a line of thunderstorms over the course of a few hours. Discrete thunderstorms initiated during the early evening hours near Lubbock, where a cold front which had moved through the Panhandle the previous day had become stationary. These discrete thunderstorms moved to the north and entered the southeastern portion of the Texas Panhandle. During this same time frame, scattered thunderstorms over eastern New Mexico were slowly merging into a linear structure. Shortly after 6 PM CST, the broken line entered the western most portion of the Texas Panhandle as the discrete thunderstorms moved into over the eastern edge of the Caprock Escarpment. By 7 PM CST, the broken line of thunderstorms began producing severe level wind gusts while a discrete thunderstorm over Hutchinson County produced hail up to the size of golf balls. The line moved quickly across the Texas Panhandle reaching the central point of the panhandle around 9 PM CST. By this point discrete thunderstorms had transitioned from hail producers to heavy rain producers. The line of thunderstorms remained a severe gust producer as it moved across the panhandle. By 10 PM CST, the line moved into an area of lower instability and the effects of the nocturnal inversion became evident as the line began breaking apart.

A squall line developed across southeast Arkansas and moved quickly across north-central Mississippi during the morning, producing multiple reports of damaging winds and ping-pong to golf ball size hail. There were reports of multiple trees blown down, some roofs blown off buildings and wind gusts of 60-80 mph, with a 77 mph wind gust measured at the Columbus AFB surface observing station. A lone supercell moved across southeast Arkansas just after 1:00 pm and showed many indications of very large hail and strong rotation. This storm gradually began making more of a right turn and continued to dive southeast across northeast Louisiana before moving into Mississippi. This storm produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail as it continued to dive southeast, shattering windows in homes and vehicles. This storm gradually weakened as another storm began to develop just to the southwest over Morehouse Parish. The storm continued to move southeast with the southern edge of the storm beginning to develop supercell characteristics. This storm became the focus of activity as it began rapidly increasing in intensity and showing signs of producing large hail. Ping pong to tennis ball size hail fell as the storm moved into northern Warren County, breaking numerous windows on vehicles near Redwood. Strong winds blew a tree on a house and caused a minor injury near Redwood. The long-lived supercell continued to move into a favorable environment and produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail along its path as it moved into the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone was softball size, or 4.25 inches, which fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This supercell continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golf ball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused major roof damage, shattered windshields and caused dents in numerous vehicles and siding damage to multiple mobile homes in the Jackson metro area. The squall line in northeastern Mississippi produced an outflow boundary that moved to the south and southeast which would serve as a focus for additional thunderstorm development ahead of the storm moving into western Mississippi. Thunderstorms began increasing in intensity along the outflow boundary and numerous reports of large hail continued in a swath down into southern Mississippi. Reports of golf ball to baseball size hail were received along a line from Seminary to Natchez and a few golf ball size hailstones fell south of Columbia. As the actual cold front finally made its way through the I-20 corridor and south, additional hail fell during the evening. However, this hail was significantly smaller than what fell earlier, with sizes ranging from nickel to quarter size. The thunderstorms gradually moved out of the Pine Belt region late on the evening of the 18th.  An elementary school in Clinton was damaged bad enough to have to close for the remainder of the school year, and many state and local law enforcement vehicles were heavily damaged or totaled. The amount of damages to the Jackson metro area were staggering and will be remembered for years to come. The hailstone that fell in Clinton was the 3rd largest hailstone in March in Mississippi since 1950, only surpassed by a grapefruit size hailstone that fell on March 30th, 1993 in Puckett, MS and on March 6th, 1996 in Laurel, MS.

At the same time, a potent upper level disturbance over Ontario started to approach the region and a strong jet streak was located just to the north.  With a moist southerly flow moving into the region at the surface, it became rather humid as well.    With all these ingredients coming together, thunderstorms developed across western and central New York by mid afternoon and they began to spread eastward into eastern New York by the late afternoon and evening hours.  Many of the thunderstorms organized into a strong squall line, producing widespread wind damage, especially across northern portions of the Capital Region and in the mid-Hudson Valley. These thunderstorms produced a significant amount of lightning, as well, which in combination with the widespread wind damage, led to a significant number of power outages across the area.  Many schools in the Capital Region were delayed or closed on Thursday, May 30th as a result of the power outages.  In addition, a few supercell thunderstorms developed ahead of the line.  Three tornadoes were spawned by these supercell storms across the Capital Region and Schoharie County.  The strongest tornado was rated EF2 by a National Weather Service storm survey, and tracked on the ground for 13 miles across eastern Montgomery and Schenectady Counties.  One injury occurred as a result of this tornado, as a man was pulled out of a barn by the force of the wind.  Significant damage to trees occurred, along with damage to high tension power line towers and roofs blown off houses.  The other tornadoes were rated EF1, were rather short-lived and mainly caused damage to trees.  With the region already rather saturated from repeated thunderstorms over the past week, the additional heavy rainfall that occurred caused flash flooding in some areas.

While only isolated thunderstorms occurred, the line produced convective wind damage across portions of western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The highest measured wind gusts were 67 MPH at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, and 62 MPH at the Wheeling, WV airport.

430878,1/30/2013 22:05,54,MG,This wind gust was measured with home weather station equipment.,"Unseasonably warm air, with afternoon temperatures reaching into the 60s and low 70s, and a surge of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico interacted with a slow moving cold front during the afternoon and evening hours of January 30th, resulting in strong low-topped showers and thunderstorms and widespread heavy rainfall. Despite weak CAPE associated with the frontal passage, low level wind shear was in excess of 60 knots across the region, which produced  lines of showers, often with strong winds but little to no lightning. Precipitable water values were observed to be in the 1.0 to 1.5 inch range, which is extremely high for January across the Appalachians and the nearby Piedmont region. To add to the flooding threat, ground conditions were already saturated from recent rain and snow during the days and weeks preceding the event.  Severe weather caused power outages across portions of southwest and central Virginia, with one of the highest concentrations of power outages occurring in Pulaski County, where nearly 1250 homes and businesses were without power during the evening of January 30th. The Virginia Department of Transportation reported as many as 35 roads were closed across mainly southwest Virginia due to flooding or flooding-related problems, and that clean up costs associated with flooding, landslides and debris flow was between 1.5 and 2 million dollars.

Disturbances in the mid and upper levels rippled southeast from the lower Great Lakes initially.  Additional disturbances then moved east overnight into Thursday the 13th.     The first round of showers and thunderstorms formed across in northern Ohio during the early evening of the 12th, then raced southeast into northern West Virginia as the new calendar day began.  Those initial cells did become repetitive in a few spots, such as northern Taylor County north of Grafton.  This did not cause any serious flooding, but helped saturate the ground.  Meanwhile, another larger cluster of showers and thunderstorms moved out of northern Indiana, through Ohio, reaching into West Virginia during the predawn hours.  The southern edge of this complex became oriented west to east, along the fast flow aloft.  As a result, repetitive cells did dump heavy rain from Jackson County through southern Roane, southern Calhoun, southern Gilmer, Braxton, and Webster Counties.  Rain amounts over 2 inches were common in that west to east band.  The most serious of the flooding occurred in Roane County.   By late July, this led to a Presidential disaster declaration.  See FEMA DR-4132 for more details.   A break in the rain occurred during the mid to late morning hours on the 13th.

Similarly, isolated strong storms developed in north central NM over a second burn scar where flooding was also observed during the evening hours.  Later in the day,  a large complex of strong thunderstorms organized over north central New Mexico then slowly pushed south along the entire Rio Grande Valley into the Big Bend region of Texas. As this storm complex pushed into the Albuquerque Metro Area, a severe downburst wind measuring a historical 89mph at the Sunport surged out ahead of the storm and produced extensive damage and flash flooding to many areas along and south of Interstate 40. Several outdoor events were severely impacted, including an Albuquerque Isotopes baseball game, Summer Fest at the BioPark Zoo, and a concert at the Isleta Ampitheater. Downed tree branches and uprooted trees created extensive power outages leaving more than 25,000 customers without power. Interstate 25 was closed between the Big I and Rio Bravo Boulevard for nearly 12 hours as downed power lines and power poles were repaired along several access ramps.
