Some morning cloud cover along the North Dakota/South Dakota border lifted north by afternoon, and allowed a period of good heating. Although the upper level winds were fairly light, another in a series of upper level disturbances shifted over the area by mid afternoon. This helped initiate thunderstorm development over southeast North Dakota and west central Minnesota. A cluster of thunderstorms also developed over extreme northeast North Dakota. By late afternoon, a line of thunderstorms raced across the Mooreton (ND) area, through Wahpeton/Breckenridge, and into the Fergus Falls (MN) area.

No damage was reported.,"A complex of strong to severe thunderstorms developed over the western South Plains during the late afternoon and early evening of the 18th. A few of these storms became severe and produced locally intense wind gusts up to 67 mph.    The most significant impacts from these storms, however, occurred as an organized and expansive cold pool of outflow winds expanded east-northeastward in advance of the convection over the central South Plains. The large outflow boundary lofted vast amounts of dust from the areas relatively bare cotton fields, and a large haboob dust storm evolved to envelop much of the central South Plains. Reduced visibility, at times less than a few hundred yards, and gusts in excess of 50 mph accompanied the haboob passage. The haboob became well-separated from its parent convection, and was sustained into the 21:00 CST hour east of the Caprock escarpment.   The haboob was likely a contributor to the occurrence of a fatal aircraft mishap in Floyd County. A prominent business owner and a passenger were killed when their Cessna 182 went down in a field fifteen miles east of Floydada near the small community of Dougherty. While an official determination into the cause of the accident is pending via an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration, the time of the mishap corresponded to the occurrence of a westerly wind-shift and onset of 50+ mph surface winds and significantly reduced visibilities associated with the haboob. Doppler radar observations reveal that the top of the dust-filled outflow likely exceeded 6,500 feet above ground level.   In addition, the vast amounts of wind-driven dust destroyed thousands of acres of young cotton crops. With sensitive cotton plants just beginning to emerge, the sand blasting effect of the dust storm caused extensive damage.  Agricultural and property losses that resulted from the haboob dust storm likely approached $6 million.",33.2201,-101.7601

CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.  During the morning round of storms, lightning struck a building in Waverly.  The lightning struck an antenna on the building and melted screws all the way down the side of the building, starting a small fire and blowing hole in the wall.",41.83,-93.15

Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.

Surface temperatures soared to the low to mid 90s in most areas, with dew point temperatures in the upper 70s to mid 80s.  This resulted in most unstable CAPE values of 5000-8000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -10 to -14 C range.  The LCL was relatively high in the 1000-1500 meter range.  Downdraft CAPE was between 1400 and 1700 J/kg and there was a significant amount of CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere of 1000-1600 J/kg.  The atmosphere was weakly sheared with 25 to 35 kts of effective shear.  Shear in the zero to 3 km layer was between 50 and 250 J/kg, resulting in considerable rotation of thunderstorm cells.  The freezing level was quite high, at 14,000 feet.  Considerable moisture was available through a deep layer of the atmosphere with precipitable water values of 1.75 to 2 inches.  Thunderstorms developed over the northwest part of Iowa by early afternoon.  The storms became severe and dropped southeast into the most unstable air to the east and south of the complex.  The primary mode of severe weather with this event was in the form of high winds and hail.  Some of the hail reached golf ball in size, however with the warm atmospheric conditions much of the hail remained below severe levels.  High winds were reported all along the leading edge of the thunderstorm complex, with numerous reports in the 60 to 70 MPH range.  There were two areas where the most significant damage occurred.  The first was in the Waterloo, Cedar Falls, and Hudson areas of northeast Iowa.  A beta bow element pushed into the area resulting in more widespread wind damage.  Some of the damage was similar to what one might expect with a weak tornado.  The second area was over Dallas County.  High winds caused considerable damage from around Dallas Center, west to the county line.  An old airport field was hit by the winds with considerable damage to equipment and hangars.  Winds were estimated to be at least 80 MPH.  Later in the event, some of the storm cells collapsed with a local high wind event occurring in Hamilton County.  Two semi-tractor trailer trucks were blown over on Interstate 35 between mile post 162 and 165 in Franklin County.  There were numerous reports of wind damage around Franklin County.  Trees were blown down onto cars and houses.  Another semi-tractor trailer was blown off the highway just east of Perry on Highway 44 in Dallas County. Very heavy rain fell with the storms as well.

178653,8/10/2009 0:04,52,MG,On Highway 92 near Snyder Ave.,"A very warm, moist, and unstable airmass was in place over Iowa from 8th into the 9th.  Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.

Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.

Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.  During the morning round of storms, lightning struck a building in Waverly.

More intense and organized supercell storms formed over the Rolling Plains by the mid to late afternoon hours, however, and moved southeastward. One particularly organized and long-lived high precipitation supercell impacted the Aspermont vicinity of Stonewall County, where it produced a swath of damaging winds and at least one tornado. A 100 mph wind gust and a corresponding 32 millibar pressure drop was measured when the tornado struck the Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site northeast of Aspermont. Although no injuries were reportedly related to the tornado, severe gusts north of Aspermont overturned a tractor trailer truck injuring the driver.  Additional supercells impacted portions of Briscoe and Hale Counties, and very large wind-blown hail caused damages in both counties. Two tornadoes were observed by storm chasers in the Silverton and Quitaque vicinity of southern Briscoe County.

178643,8/9/2009 23:03,57,MG,nan,"A very warm, moist, and unstable airmass was in place over Iowa from 8th into the 9th.  Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.  During the morning round of storms, lightning struck a building in Waverly.  The lightning struck an antenna on the building and melted screws all the way down the side of the building, starting a small fire and blowing hole in the wall.",41.69,-93.57

Strong southerly flow ahead of this storm system brought ample Gulf of Mexico moisture all the way into southern Canada, setting the stage for significant precipitation accumulations across the region. Winter storm and blizzard watches and warnings were posted well in advance of the storm. Warning lead time averaged nearly 25 hours.   Precipitation started in the form of rain and thunderstorms Sunday into Monday morning, before changing over to all snow west to east Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning.  Additionally, strong northwest winds of 20 to 45 mph accompanying the snow, produced widespread blizzard conditions west during the day on Monday, then across central North Dakota Monday evening and into Tuesday morning. Further east, around the James River Basin area, winter storm warnings were in effect due to a wintry mix of rain, snow, and sleet and for lighter snow accumulations.

No damage was reported.,"A complex of strong to severe thunderstorms developed over the western South Plains during the late afternoon and early evening of the 18th. A few of these storms became severe and produced locally intense wind gusts up to 67 mph.    The most significant impacts from these storms, however, occurred as an organized and expansive cold pool of outflow winds expanded east-northeastward in advance of the convection over the central South Plains. The large outflow boundary lofted vast amounts of dust from the areas relatively bare cotton fields, and a large haboob dust storm evolved to envelop much of the central South Plains. Reduced visibility, at times less than a few hundred yards, and gusts in excess of 50 mph accompanied the haboob passage. The haboob became well-separated from its parent convection, and was sustained into the 21:00 CST hour east of the Caprock escarpment.   The haboob was likely a contributor to the occurrence of a fatal aircraft mishap in Floyd County. A prominent business owner and a passenger were killed when their Cessna 182 went down in a field fifteen miles east of Floydada near the small community of Dougherty. While an official determination into the cause of the accident is pending via an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration, the time of the mishap corresponded to the occurrence of a westerly wind-shift and onset of 50+ mph surface winds and significantly reduced visibilities associated with the haboob. Doppler radar observations reveal that the top of the dust-filled outflow likely exceeded 6,500 feet above ground level.   In addition, the vast amounts of wind-driven dust destroyed thousands of acres of young cotton crops. With sensitive cotton plants just beginning to emerge, the sand blasting effect of the dust storm caused extensive damage.  Agricultural and property losses that resulted from the haboob dust storm likely approached $6 million.",33.1511,-102.28

Surface temperatures soared to the low to mid 90s in most areas, with dew point temperatures in the upper 70s to mid 80s.  This resulted in most unstable CAPE values of 5000-8000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -10 to -14 C range.  The LCL was relatively high in the 1000-1500 meter range.  Downdraft CAPE was between 1400 and 1700 J/kg and there was a significant amount of CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere of 1000-1600 J/kg.  The atmosphere was weakly sheared with 25 to 35 kts of effective shear.  Shear in the zero to 3 km layer was between 50 and 250 J/kg, resulting in considerable rotation of thunderstorm cells.  The freezing level was quite high, at 14,000 feet.  Considerable moisture was available through a deep layer of the atmosphere with precipitable water values of 1.75 to 2 inches.  Thunderstorms developed over the northwest part of Iowa by early afternoon.  The storms became severe and dropped southeast into the most unstable air to the east and south of the complex.  The primary mode of severe weather with this event was in the form of high winds and hail.  Some of the hail reached golf ball in size, however with the warm atmospheric conditions much of the hail remained below severe levels.  High winds were reported all along the leading edge of the thunderstorm complex, with numerous reports in the 60 to 70 MPH range.  There were two areas where the most significant damage occurred.  The first was in the Waterloo, Cedar Falls, and Hudson areas of northeast Iowa.  A beta bow element pushed into the area resulting in more widespread wind damage.  Some of the damage was similar to what one might expect with a weak tornado.  The second area was over Dallas County.  High winds caused considerable damage from around Dallas Center, west to the county line.  An old airport field was hit by the winds with considerable damage to equipment and hangars.

Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.

Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.

178615,8/9/2009 15:00,68,MG,nan,"A very warm, moist, and unstable airmass was in place over Iowa from 8th into the 9th.  Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.

A significant cap was in place during the day into the evening of the 18th with 700 mb temperatures of +12 to +13 C.  Mid level temperatures cooled during the evening and overnight hours as a strong upper level trough approached the area.  The airmass remained very unstable into the early morning hours of the 19th, with CAPE in the 4000 to 5000 J/kg range and lifted indices remained in the -5 to-7 C range.  Downdraft CAPE was high at 900 to 1300 J/kg.  There was significant CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere ranging from around 700 to 900 J/kg, however the freezing level was quite high at 14,000 feet.  In addition, 1.75 to 2 inches of precipitable water was available.  Thunderstorms formed in Nebraska and moved into Iowa.  The storms were heavy precipitation storms and combined with the warm atmosphere limited the storms in hail production.  Some sub-severe hail was reported.  The storms became a forward propagating MCS and wind was the primary mode of severe weather.  Tree and power line damage was widespread with winds of 60 MPH or higher common.  The wind event took place mainly from Interstate 80 north to the U.S. 30 corridor.  In eastern Marshall County, a mesonet station recorded a 94 MPH wind gust.  Damage was widespread across eastern Marshall County into Tama County.",42.02,-92.96

The Automated Surface Observing System at the Childress Municipal Airport recorded a 102 mph thunderstorm wind gust at 21:29 CST. The nearby Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet recorded a series of severe gusts between 21:35 CST and 21:45 CST, with a peak gust of 80 mph at 21:40 CST.   Damage across the northwestern half of the city was extensive. Three people were injured when the walls of a motel collapsed just off of U.S. Highway 287. Two other hotels sustained heavy damages. Minor roof damage was additionally reported at the Childress Regional Medical Center and the Childress High School.","A complex of thunderstorms swept southeastward over the South Plains region of west Texas during the evening hours of the 29th. These storms resulted in widespread severe wind gusts. Damage across the region was generally limited to downed tree limbs and utilities, however, a segment of the convective complex that moved over the extreme southeastern Panhandle produced extreme wind gusts that caused significant structural damage. These winds resulted in the partial collapse of a brick structure in Estelline (Hall County). More significant damage occurred as the winds spread into Childress (Childress County), where a number of buildings were heavily damaged including three local hotels, a hospital, and the high school as measured wind gusts reached 102 mph. Three people were injured and economic losses across the region exceeded $2.2 million.",34.43,-100.3
186731,8/9/2009 15:32,89,MG,A wind gust of 102 MPH was recorded at the Landfill northwest of Eldora.,"A very warm, moist, and unstable airmass was in place over Iowa from 8th into the 9th.  Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.  During the morning round of storms, lightning struck a building in Waverly.  The lightning struck an antenna on the building and melted screws all the way down the side of the building, starting a small fire and blowing hole in the wall.",42.4054,-93.2504
