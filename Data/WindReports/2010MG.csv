The winds caused major damage to at least one roof in or near Ashland with numerous large tree limbs and a few trees downed from southwest of town into town.  The fallen trees damaged several houses and vehicles in the area.,"Thunderstorms developed by mid afternoon on Sept. 13 along and north of a warm front that had moved into east central Nebraska.  The air mass south of the boundary was moderately unstable with temperatures in the mid to upper 80s and dew point temperatures around 70.  Additional thunderstorms developed in this unstable air mass south of the front, several of which were supercells.  One supercell, the right-mover of a storm that split in Jefferson county produced a brief tornado southwest of Fairbury.  Meanwhile, another supercell produced a swath of wind damage as it tracked south-southeast from around Wahoo into the southeast corner of Nebraska.  Especially hard hit from that particular storm was the area from southeast Saunders county into Cass and Otoe counties where winds were estimated by an assessment team from the NWS at 60 to 80 mph.  Several semi-trucks were blown off of Interstate 80 in this area and almost 3,000 customers lost power due to significant damage to trees, power poles/lines, houses and other structures in that region.

At 7 pm CDT, the first line of thunderstorms entered the Rio Grande Valley and produced hail up to the size of nickels, localized flooding and strong winds.  The second line of thunderstorms extended across much of Central Texas and began accelerating and tracking southward from Tilden to Goliad by late in the evening.  The two lines of thunderstorms merged around Tilden and Choke Canyon Reservoir near 1000 pm CDT causing intensification to the convective complex of storms.  This was evident by severe storms over Live Oak and Bee counties with increased reflectivity and cloud to ground lightning between 1030 and 1100 pm CDT.  At the same time, the northern line of thunderstorms continued through the Victoria Crossroads area and slowly weakened.  The strongest portion of the solid line of thunderstorms continued southeastward into the central Coastal Bend. Reports of trees down and power outages increased from along I-37 to Corpus Christi from the most intense portion of the line of thunderstorms.  WSR-88D detected small areas of rotation over Aransas, San Patricio and Nueces Counties between 1100 and  midnight CDT when tornado warnings were issued.  Wind gusts of 60 mph were common from automated weather stations as the storms slammed the lower Coastal Bend.  Power outages from the wind were significant by midnight and there were many reports of trees and power lines down, and rescue operations for recreational trailers that were tipped over on the base of Navy Corpus Christi and a flipped 18-wheeler. In this area, automated sensors measured wind as high as 80 mph.  The lightning was intense and continuous at times, which caused additional damage to a few structures.

The first round of severe storms, in the form of a MCS, rolled from west to east across the area within a few hours after sunrise. This complex of storms first organized across Northeast Colorado and Southwest Nebraska shortly after midnight, before rolling east-southeast into North Central Kansas. These storms were slightly elevated, focusing along the nose of a low level jet, and slightly north of a nearly stationary, east-west surface front draped across Central Kansas. The synoptic environment featured considerable instability, with MUCAPE values of 3000-4000 J/kg, and deep-layer wind shear of 30-40 knots. These storms produced both large hail and damaging winds, with hail up to golf ball size reported in Phillips County, and wind gusts to around 65 MPH in both Phillips and Mitchell Counties. In the Cawker City and Glen Elder areas, there was tree damage and significant structural damage to at least one mobile home.   After a lull in the action that lasted most of the day, the second round of severe weather flared up during the late afternoon, lasting well into the evening hours. These storms focused directly along the east-west surface front, which had moved north during the day in response to deepening low pressure across the Central High Plains. Around storm initiation time, the environment was again very supportive of significant severe weather, with MLCAPE values around 4000 J/kg, and 40 knots of deep-layer wind shear. In addition, things were also becoming increasingly favorable for tornadoes, with 0-1 km storm-relative helicity climbing into the 200-300 m2/s2 range, and 0-1 km bulk shear of 20-25 knots. Given these parameters, storms started out as semi-discrete supercells, the strongest of which produced an EF1 tornado near Randall in Jewell County that damaged a farmstead. Although this was the only tornado reported during the evening, there were numerous reports of large hail, high winds and flooding rainfall as the initial storms merged into a nearly stationary east-west line that remained draped over parts of the area for several hours. Flash flooding resulted in water over several roads, with radar estimations of at least 5-7 inches of rain across parts of southern Phillips County and adjacent areas.

Thunderstorms formed in two clusters.  One extended from Minnesota southwest into eastern South Dakota.  The other area was over central Nebraska.  The convective area from South Dakota dropped southeast into Iowa during the late evening hours.  It produced high winds and hail as it did.  Hail was not the major mode of severe weather.  Most of the larger hail occurred during the early stages of the storm.  Golf ball size hail fell west of Graettinger in Palo Alto County for the largest hail report.  The cluster of storms organized into a small derecho as it approached Fort Dodge.  The derecho raced southeast through the Des Moines area and into southeast Iowa.  It produced some hail as it did, but by in large high winds were the primary threat.  Winds of 60 to 75 MPH were common, causing considerable tree damage.  High winds of 65 to 75 MPH roared through Ames.  A shelter at the Iowa State Veterinary Medicine School was blown over.  Several horses were injured by the collapse.  University officials has to euthanize one horse due to severe injuries.  A measured wind gust of 84 MPH was recorded on the northwest side of the Des Moines Metro area.  Power was knocked out to nearly 40,000 customers in central Iowa by the storms.  Damage reports from along the path of the derecho were widespread.  Grain bins were destroyed as well as numerous out buildings.  Tree and power line damage was extensive all the way from the Minnesota border through south central Iowa.  Heavy rain was also an issue with the storms.  Rainfall of 1 to 2 inches per hour fell with the storms from Fort Dodge into the Des Moines area.  Flash flooding was reported in Marion County.  Heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in under 2 hours flooded city streets in Knoxville, some 4 feet deep, with cars stalled in city streets.  Water was also over the road southeast of Melcher-Dallas in Marion County.  Flash flooding was reported in Webster City.  Flooding blew manhole covers off and stalled several cars in the city.

The initial wave of severe storms developed during the mid to late evening hours, mainly west of Highway 183 in the vicinity of a quasi-stationary surface front draped from Northwest Kansas to East Central Nebraska. With surface dewpoints pushing the low 70s in many areas, the airmass was quite unstable as storms organized, with MLCAPE values into the 3000-4000 J/kg range. A few of these initial storms were supercells, with one producing a brief EF0 tornado shortly after nightfall in central Gosper County with no damage reported.   As the initial cluster of storms pushed east toward the Highway 281 corridor toward midnight, wind damage became increasingly common. Southern Adams County was one of the hardest hit areas, with grain bins blown onto railroad tracks in Ayr, and signficant tree damage and some structural damage just north of Ayr at Crystal Lake. As this intial wave of storms weakened somewhat, another severe squall line surged into western sections of South Central Nebraska after midnight, aided by strong convergence along the nose of a 40-50 knot low level jet. With this line of late-night storms, damaging winds were not only reported along the leading edge of the outflow, but also in association with a wake low pressure system that developed behind the main squall line. These winds associated with the wake low pounded western Dawson County for several minutes, with reports of uprooted trees and damage to signs and a gazebo in Cozad. As the leading edge of the bowing squall line reached the Highway 281 corridor after 2 am, Adams County was again struck with damaging winds clocked as high as 73 MPH at the Hastings airport.

By mid afternoon, the well-defined front was located from parts of west-central into central Oklahoma, just north of the Oklahoma City metro area. Two thunderstorms developed near and along the front, one over Roger Mills and Dewey counties, and the other over northern Blaine county. The storms quickly became tornadic, with the first tornado of the day occurring north of Leedey in Dewey county. Another tornado, and probably the most photographed one of the day, occurred just north of Hennessey. Tornadoes, most of them brief in duration, and large hail continued  across western and central Kingfisher county, and across northern Logan, southeast Garfield, and Payne counties. Another thunderstorm developed further east along the dry line later in the afternoon, and the storm eventually produced a tornado west of Prague in Lincoln county.   Finally, two supercell thunderstorms developed further south along the dry line that moved into central Oklahoma.

Initially the airmass was very dry, however a strong push of moisture increased surface dew points into the upper 60s to low 70s by mid afternoon.  Precipitable water values increased to 1.25 to 1.5 inches.  The atmosphere destabilized by mid to late afternoon.  Most unstable CAPE increased to 5000 J/kg as the lifted index fell to -9 to -12 C.  The freezing level was relative low, around 12,000 feet.  Available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere increased to between 500 and 1000 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The atmosphere was moderately sheared with 40 to 55 kts of effective shear in the near storm environment.  With the relatively dry air initially on the leading edge of the developing storms, the LCL was a relatively high 1500 meters.  Thunderstorms formed in two areas.  The first was over northwest Iowa along the cold frontal boundary.  The second area developed over eastern Nebraska and tracked east in the warm advection area along and north of the warm frontal boundary.  The two areas of storms combined during the evening hours, becoming a full fledged MCC by mid evening.  All modes of severe weather occurred with this system, though the predominate mode was large hail.  Thunderstorms formed rapidly along the warm frontal boundary during the mid and late afternoon.  Hail up to baseball size was reported in southwest Iowa with these storms.  Rapid intensification led to golf ball and larger hail in Taylor, Ringgold, Adams, and Union Counties.  One of the storms produced a tornado as it moved through Ringgold County in the Tingley area.  A large farmstead was hit, causing $4,000,000 damage.  Eight buildings were damaged or destroyed, as well as the farmstead itself.  Based upon extensive destruction to a 400 foot long metal cattle barn on the farmstead, it was determined that the tornado was of EF-2 strength with winds of up to 130 MPH.  Other buildings, including the home, received extensive damage but not as widespread.  Three head of cattle were killed when the cattle barn was destroyed.  During the early evening the storm system transitioned into more of a high wind event.  Several reports of 50 to 70 MPH winds were received.  A wind gust in excess of 60 MPH threw house debris onto the street in Ottumwa.  The storms produced heavy rainfall of 2 inches or more per hour.  Fortunately they were moving relatively quickly.  Storms trained over parts of Guthrie County.  Over 4 inches of rain fell north and west of Guthrie Center.  The heavy rainfall caused minor flooding with ditches filled and minor road flooding.  A small area of flash flooding was reported along Seely Creek in Guthrie County with water a few feet over the road.  Lightning caused at least two house fires.

236936,6/12/2010 7:49,53,MG,nan,"Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms, mainly producing damaging winds and torrential rainfall, made for a very active Friday evening and early Saturday morning across much of South Central Nebraska. The initial wave of severe storms developed during the mid to late evening hours, mainly west of Highway 183 in the vicinity of a quasi-stationary surface front draped from Northwest Kansas to East Central Nebraska. With surface dewpoints pushing the low 70s in many areas, the airmass was quite unstable as storms organized, with MLCAPE values into the 3000-4000 J/kg range. A few of these initial storms were supercells, with one producing a brief EF0 tornado shortly after nightfall in central Gosper County with no damage reported.   As the initial cluster of storms pushed east toward the Highway 281 corridor toward midnight, wind damage became increasingly common. Southern Adams County was one of the hardest hit areas, with grain bins blown onto railroad tracks in Ayr, and signficant tree damage and some structural damage just north of Ayr at Crystal Lake. As this intial wave of storms weakened somewhat, another severe squall line surged into western sections of South Central Nebraska after midnight, aided by strong convergence along the nose of a 40-50 knot low level jet. With this line of late-night storms, damaging winds were not only reported along the leading edge of the outflow, but also in association with a wake low pressure system that developed behind the main squall line. These winds associated with the wake low pounded western Dawson County for several minutes, with reports of uprooted trees and damage to signs and a gazebo in Cozad. As the leading edge of the bowing squall line reached the Highway 281 corridor after 2 am, Adams County was again struck with damaging winds clocked as high as 73 MPH at the Hastings airport. Winds gusts in excess of 60 MPH also pressed east through the Aurora and York areas.   In addition to fairly widespread wind damage, portions of South Central Nebraska received heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches during the night. With the ground already saturated in areas mainly north of Interstate 80, flooding resulted. One of the most noteworthy flash flooding events affected the community of North Loup in Valley County along the Mira Creek. A dam break on the Bredthauer Dam, located approximately five miles northwest of town, allowed 1 to 2 feet of water to inundate much of North Loup on Saturday afternoon, with evacuations necessary.",40.88,-98

The first round of storms flared up around midnight, in a northwest-southeast corridor stretching from Dawson County to Franklin County. These storms initiated along a rather subtle low to mid level convergence zone, in a very unstable airmass featuring 4000-5000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear. Severe weather reports included estimated wind gusts to 60 MPH, and hail up to quarter size, along with locally heavy rainfall.   Following a lull that lasted through the day, the evening hours brought one of the most significant severe weather episodes of the summer to the area, as a concentrated swath of damaging 60-90 MPH wind gusts swept eastward along and near the Interstate 80 corridor. These severe storms actually resulted from a merger between storms moving east from Southwest Nebraska, and other storms dropping south from North Central Nebraska. These initial storms developed in closer proximity to a surface cold front and trough axis, trailing southward from low pressure centered over the Dakotas. Around sunset, these smaller storm clusters merged as they entered Dawson and Buffalo Counties, quickly evolving into a forward-propagating mesoscale convective system (MCS) with damaging outflow winds. As storms first entered South Central Nebraska, the mesoscale environment featured 3000-4500 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and around 30 knots of deep-layer vertical shear. Over the course of around 3 hours, wind damage was widespread near the Interstate 80 corridor, but especially within Buffalo County, where gusts estimated as high as 90 MPH resulted in numerous damage reports. To name just a few, these reports included a roof torn from a home, numerous grain bins damaged or destroyed, and a number of power poles snapped, causing power outages in the area.  Nebraska Public Power District estimated 32 miles of power lines and 218 individual power structures were blown down in the Buffalo County area. Multiple reports were also received of damage to area trees and crops. Farther east, winds were not quite as strong, but still maintained severe levels as gusts to 68 MPH were measured at the Hastings airport, and 61 MPH at the Aurora airport.

CAPE was in the 4000 to 5000 J/kg range with lifted indices of -8 to -11 C.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high, 1200-1400 J/kg.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 500 J/kg.  The atmosphere was quite strongly sheared with 45 to 60 kts of shear.  Precipitable water was low, only 1 to 1.5 inches.  With the relatively dry air, the LCL was between 1500 and 2500 meters.  The airmass was also quite warm with the freezing level around 15,600 feet.  Thunderstorms formed in two clusters.  One extended from Minnesota southwest into eastern South Dakota.  The other area was over central Nebraska.  The convective area from South Dakota dropped southeast into Iowa during the late evening hours.  It produced high winds and hail as it did.  Hail was not the major mode of severe weather.  Most of the larger hail occurred during the early stages of the storm.  Golf ball size hail fell west of Graettinger in Palo Alto County for the largest hail report.  The cluster of storms organized into a small derecho as it approached Fort Dodge.  The derecho raced southeast through the Des Moines area and into southeast Iowa.  It produced some hail as it did, but by in large high winds were the primary threat.  Winds of 60 to 75 MPH were common, causing considerable tree damage.  High winds of 65 to 75 MPH roared through Ames.  A shelter at the Iowa State Veterinary Medicine School was blown over.  Several horses were injured by the collapse.  University officials has to euthanize one horse due to severe injuries.  A measured wind gust of 84 MPH was recorded on the northwest side of the Des Moines Metro area.

Quarter size hail fell in Calhoun County as an intense storm passed though.  The same storm cluster produced a funnel cloud in Sac County earlier.  Scattered winds occurred with the storms.  A 61 MPH wind gust was recorded in Eagle Grove for example and windows were blown out in Humboldt County south of Thor.  One of the thunderstorms produced a tornado in Emmet County.  The tornado touched down briefly over Lake Iowa.  Thunderstorms became more organized during the evening and produced very heavy rainfall.  In addition to the rainfall, scattered reports of high winds and some hail up to an inch and one quarter in size were received.  Most of the wind reports were around 60 MPH.  By far the most significant weather was the heavy rainfall.  Three to 5 inches of rain fell on saturated ground, resulting in a very widespread flash flood event.

The flash flooding transitioned into widespread flooding as the night progressed into the day of the 11th.  Flash flooding resulted in evacuations of apartments and trailer courts on the east side of Des Moines.  Interstate 35 was covered by water due to flash flooding at mile post 97.  Several cars spun out in the flood waters.  Very intense rainfall in the Ames area resulted in a record crest on Squaw Creek.  The creek crested 1.5 to 2.5 feet above the record high stage.  Major flooding took place and the water treatment plant was inundated.  Major damage was done to several buildings on the Iowa State Campus.

This severe weather event brought the regions most monetarily significant weather-related impacts of 2010, and dealt an extensive loss to South Plains cotton crops - the staple of the local economy.  Thunderstorms developed as discrete supercells over the southwestern South Plains during the mid afternoon hours.  As storms increased in number and intensity, swaths of large hail devastated cotton crops.  The most significant damages occurred in Terry, Lynn, and Lubbock Counties.  At the time, South Plains crops were at maturity and farmers had just begun harvests and cotton markets were trading at a historic high of $1.26 per pound.    Post-storm surveys indicated that an estimated 100,000 acres of cotton were severely degraded or destroyed.  Total economic damages were estimated to approach $50 million by state officials.  Newspaper articles across the region contained interviews from individual farmers that claimed losses in excess of $50,000.  Losses were not fully recouped from insurance, since pay-outs were based upon decade-long earning histories and not reflective of record high cotton prices that would have been realized by a healthy harvest.  Further, local agricultural officials stated that the devastating storms struck at a time when producers had the maximum investment in crops, so the true impact on the local economy may be immeasurable.

Downdraft CAPE was around 1500 J/kg with available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere between 800 and 1100 J/kg.  With the humid airmass, precipitable water values were between 1.8 and 2 inches, resulting in a relatively low LCL level of 750 to 1000 meters.  The freezing level was relatively high, around 14,500 feet.  The shear was not all that strong, ranging from around 35 kts over northern Iowa to 20 over the southwest.  Thunderstorms fired up initially during the mid to late afternoon hours.  The storms consolidated into a solid line during the evening and advanced east-southeast across the state.  During the early stages of the development, the thunderstorms produced several tornadoes.  One touched down briefly near Lakota in Kossuth County along U.S. Highway 169.  A second tornado tracked from southwest of Lakota to north of the city.  A third tornado was on the ground briefly east of Rake in Winnebago County.  The storms then transitioned into more of a wind and hail event.  Due to the warm conditions aloft, most of the hail was only around in inch or so in diameter.  Golf ball size hail fell in the Buffalo Center area of Winnebago County.  The largest hail was a report of baseball size hail west of Ledyard in Kossuth County.  Winds increased as the evening went on and the system accelerated.  Tree damage was reported in several locations with winds gusting in the 60 to 70 MPH range.",42.05,-94.79

The freezing level fell slightly from the previous night and was around 13,500 to 14,000 feet.  Lifted indices were only in the -1 to -3 C range.  The shear was about the same as the previous night, in the 20 to 35 kt range, however precipitable water values fell to 1.1 to 1.5 inches.  As the warm air returned, thunderstorms developed before dawn.  They increased in strength as a weak shortwave approached the area.  The thunderstorms formed into a cluster over northeast Nebraska into western Iowa after sunrise.  The small MCS took on a mini bow type configuration.  Though there were a few reports of hail of up to an inch in diameter, the primary mode of severe weather was high winds from the bowing system.  Wind speeds of 60 to 80 MPH were common along the leading edge of the storm.  Tree damage was widespread over a several county wide area.  Some property damage was done by the winds as well due to flying debris.  The thunderstorms continued southeast into southeast Iowa during the late morning and early afternoon and weakened slowly.  Another line of thunderstorms formed over northwest Iowa by late morning and continued into the mid afternoon hours.  These storms produced high winds, heavy rainfall, and hail.  The hail was generally around an inch in diameter, with the largest being golf ball size in Webster County.  Golf ball size hail also fell in Warren County at Milo.  Wind speeds were in the 60 to 65 MPH range for the most part, resulting in tree and power line damage.  A tornado touched down in open fields in Madison county north of St Charles.  The heavy rainfall resulted in some flash flooding as well.  Soil conditions across the state were nearly saturated, so a quick 1 to 2 inches of rainfall caused local flash flooding in Black Hawk, Marion, and Tama Counties.",41.68,-93.63

Strong thunderstorms developed over southern Minnesota.  Initially, the thunderstorms moved east.  Once they became more rooted in the boundary layer, they moved southeast and propagated nearly due south.  The main severe threat was high winds, with numerous reports of tree, power line, and grain bin damage.  Winds of 70 MPH were measured in Estherville for example.  Seventy MPH winds were reported in Grundy County.  The outflow boundary from the complex continued to move southeast, and actually moved all the way into Missouri.  Scattered severe weather occurred with this.  Seven power poles were snapped in Polk County by the high winds.  A wind gust of 62 MPH occurred at the Ottumwa Airport.  Flash flooding also became a problem with the antecedent soil conditions nearly saturated.  Flash flooding in Emmet County resulted in the closing of Highway 4 near Wallingford and evacuations in the city.  A secondary area of thunderstorms formed over northwest Iowa and moved east-southeast into the CWA.  Heavy rains caused minor urban flooding in Calhoun County with 6 inches of standing water reported in the city of Pomeroy.

236931,6/12/2010 7:00,55,MG,nan,"Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms, mainly producing damaging winds and torrential rainfall, made for a very active Friday evening and early Saturday morning across much of South Central Nebraska. The initial wave of severe storms developed during the mid to late evening hours, mainly west of Highway 183 in the vicinity of a quasi-stationary surface front draped from Northwest Kansas to East Central Nebraska. With surface dewpoints pushing the low 70s in many areas, the airmass was quite unstable as storms organized, with MLCAPE values into the 3000-4000 J/kg range. A few of these initial storms were supercells, with one producing a brief EF0 tornado shortly after nightfall in central Gosper County with no damage reported.   As the initial cluster of storms pushed east toward the Highway 281 corridor toward midnight, wind damage became increasingly common. Southern Adams County was one of the hardest hit areas, with grain bins blown onto railroad tracks in Ayr, and signficant tree damage and some structural damage just north of Ayr at Crystal Lake. As this intial wave of storms weakened somewhat, another severe squall line surged into western sections of South Central Nebraska after midnight, aided by strong convergence along the nose of a 40-50 knot low level jet. With this line of late-night storms, damaging winds were not only reported along the leading edge of the outflow, but also in association with a wake low pressure system that developed behind the main squall line. These winds associated with the wake low pounded western Dawson County for several minutes, with reports of uprooted trees and damage to signs and a gazebo in Cozad. As the leading edge of the bowing squall line reached the Highway 281 corridor after 2 am, Adams County was again struck with damaging winds clocked as high as 73 MPH at the Hastings airport. Winds gusts in excess of 60 MPH also pressed east through the Aurora and York areas.   In addition to fairly widespread wind damage, portions of South Central Nebraska received heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches during the night. With the ground already saturated in areas mainly north of Interstate 80, flooding resulted. One of the most noteworthy flash flooding events affected the community of North Loup in Valley County along the Mira Creek. A dam break on the Bredthauer Dam, located approximately five miles northwest of town, allowed 1 to 2 feet of water to inundate much of North Loup on Saturday afternoon, with evacuations necessary.",40.78,-99.77

232281,5/10/2010 22:20,55,MG,nan,"A significant outbreak of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes affected a large part of northern, central, and southern Oklahoma. Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas.  Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.  During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.  The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.  During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.  More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic.   By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storms fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted.   While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives.   Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes. Injury numbers were included when we had confidence in the numbers.   Note: The complex nature of storm evolutions and interactions made the job of classifying tornadoes difficult.

An initial report of a funnel cloud was received just before 9 pm north of Mercer, Missouri, with numerous reports of funnel clouds, tornadoes, and wind damage.f the photographs.   Emergency management officials scoured the areas across which these supercell thunderstorms tracked, but found little damage.  Though eight separate reports of tornadoes were received, tornado damage of EF0 only could be confirmed approximately 5 miles east of Princeton, where a shed was destroyed, 3 miles southwest of Milan, where the roof was torn from a garage, and in the town of Harris, where a roof was blown off. Aside from these tornadoes, straight line winds destroyed two camper trailers, and blew in a garage door, 10 miles northeast of Atlanta.  In Atlanta, quarter sized hail was reported twice during the night.   The severe weather threat ended, only to be replaced by flash flooding, as thunderstorms continued to track across the same areas of northeast Missouri, during the overnight hours. Hardest hit was the Kirksville area, where radar estimated rainfall of 8 to 10 inches. A survey of both automated and manually read rain gages, measured anywhere from 3 to 6 inches across portions of Putnam, Sullivan, Adair, and Macon Counties, with at least one measurement of 9.13 inches being reported 1 mile south of Kirksville.

This outbreak brought 13 tornadoes to the forecast area. This occurred as potent storm system moved out of the Rockies and developed a strong area of low pressure across the Central Plains. This surface low caused a warm front to take shape and quickly lift northward across the forecast during the afternoon of the 29th. Warm and humid conditions pushed north, which led to unstable conditions over the region just ahead of the advancing strong cold front. The wind energy through the atmosphere was strong. The resulting wind shear (change in wind speed or direction with height) was strong and very favorable for rotating storms and supporting tornadoes. As the clash of systems occurred, a mix of supercell thunderstorms developed, along with a broken line of thunderstorms. A handful of these storms utilized the strong wind shear present and produced tornadoes. Overall, 13 tornadoes occurred with 5 being of the strong variety (EF2-EF3). The strongest tornado occurred over northwest Leake and southern Attala Counties. Here, an EF3 moved along a 10 mile path and destroyed numerous mobile homes, 6 people were injured. Four other strong tornadoes occurred and were all rated EF2. Two of these occurred in Yazoo County, one just southwest of Yazoo City and the other in Downtown Yazoo City. Numerous buildings were damaged along with many trees and power lines down. Another EF2 occurred in Starkville where it destroyed multiple mobile homes in town. Fifteen injuries occurred in this area. The final EF2 occurred in Smith County. This tornado had an 11 mile path which started just SW of Raleigh to 6 miles NE of Raleigh. One brick home sustained significant damage along with numerous other buildings and sheds damaged.  This outbreak broke a streak of 3 years when no tornadoes occurred during the month of November across Mississippi. Additionally, the last Fall outbreak of tornadoes occurred on November 24, 2004.

Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas.  Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.  During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.  The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.  During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.  More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic.   By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storms fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted.   While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives.   Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes. Injury numbers were included when we had confidence in the numbers.   Note: The complex nature of storm evolutions and interactions made the job of classifying tornadoes difficult.

The initial wave of severe storms developed during the mid to late evening hours, mainly west of Highway 183 in the vicinity of a quasi-stationary surface front draped from Northwest Kansas to East Central Nebraska. With surface dewpoints pushing the low 70s in many areas, the airmass was quite unstable as storms organized, with MLCAPE values into the 3000-4000 J/kg range. A few of these initial storms were supercells, with one producing a brief EF0 tornado shortly after nightfall in central Gosper County with no damage reported.   As the initial cluster of storms pushed east toward the Highway 281 corridor toward midnight, wind damage became increasingly common. Southern Adams County was one of the hardest hit areas, with grain bins blown onto railroad tracks in Ayr, and signficant tree damage and some structural damage just north of Ayr at Crystal Lake. As this intial wave of storms weakened somewhat, another severe squall line surged into western sections of South Central Nebraska after midnight, aided by strong convergence along the nose of a 40-50 knot low level jet. With this line of late-night storms, damaging winds were not only reported along the leading edge of the outflow, but also in association with a wake low pressure system that developed behind the main squall line. These winds associated with the wake low pounded western Dawson County for several minutes, with reports of uprooted trees and damage to signs and a gazebo in Cozad. As the leading edge of the bowing squall line reached the Highway 281 corridor after 2 am, Adams County was again struck with damaging winds clocked as high as 73 MPH at the Hastings airport.

Surface temperatures warmed into the mid 80s to low 90s, with dew point temperatures in the mid 70s to around 80 by mid afternoon.  A weak cold front was approaching the state at the same time that a negatively tilted shortwave lifted northeast across the upper Midwest.  The atmosphere became very unstable with lifted indices falling to around -9 C.  CAPE rose to between 3000 and 4500 J/kg by late afternoon.  Downdraft CAPE was around 1500 J/kg with available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere between 800 and 1100 J/kg.  With the humid airmass, precipitable water values were between 1.8 and 2 inches, resulting in a relatively low LCL level of 750 to 1000 meters.  The freezing level was relatively high, around 14,500 feet.  The shear was not all that strong, ranging from around 35 kts over northern Iowa to 20 over the southwest.  Thunderstorms fired up initially during the mid to late afternoon hours.  The storms consolidated into a solid line during the evening and advanced east-southeast across the state.  During the early stages of the development, the thunderstorms produced several tornadoes.  One touched down briefly near Lakota in Kossuth County along U.S. Highway 169.  A second tornado tracked from southwest of Lakota to north of the city.  A third tornado was on the ground briefly east of Rake in Winnebago County.  The storms then transitioned into more of a wind and hail event.  Due to the warm conditions aloft, most of the hail was only around in inch or so in diameter.  Golf ball size hail fell in the Buffalo Center area of Winnebago County.  The largest hail was a report of baseball size hail west of Ledyard in Kossuth County.  Winds increased as the evening went on and the system accelerated.  Tree damage was reported in several locations with winds gusting in the 60 to 70 MPH range.",42.59,-93.53

The first round of storms flared up around midnight, in a northwest-southeast corridor stretching from Dawson County to Franklin County. These storms initiated along a rather subtle low to mid level convergence zone, in a very unstable airmass featuring 4000-5000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear. Severe weather reports included estimated wind gusts to 60 MPH, and hail up to quarter size, along with locally heavy rainfall.   Following a lull that lasted through the day, the evening hours brought one of the most significant severe weather episodes of the summer to the area, as a concentrated swath of damaging 60-90 MPH wind gusts swept eastward along and near the Interstate 80 corridor. These severe storms actually resulted from a merger between storms moving east from Southwest Nebraska, and other storms dropping south from North Central Nebraska. These initial storms developed in closer proximity to a surface cold front and trough axis, trailing southward from low pressure centered over the Dakotas. Around sunset, these smaller storm clusters merged as they entered Dawson and Buffalo Counties, quickly evolving into a forward-propagating mesoscale convective system (MCS) with damaging outflow winds. As storms first entered South Central Nebraska, the mesoscale environment featured 3000-4500 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and around 30 knots of deep-layer vertical shear. Over the course of around 3 hours, wind damage was widespread near the Interstate 80 corridor, but especially within Buffalo County, where gusts estimated as high as 90 MPH resulted in numerous damage reports. To name just a few, these reports included a roof torn from a home, numerous grain bins damaged or destroyed, and a number of power poles snapped, causing power outages in the area.  Nebraska Public Power District estimated 32 miles of power lines and 218 individual power structures were blown down in the Buffalo County area. Multiple reports were also received of damage to area trees and crops.

Thunderstorms formed in two clusters.  One extended from Minnesota southwest into eastern South Dakota.  The other area was over central Nebraska.  The convective area from South Dakota dropped southeast into Iowa during the late evening hours.  It produced high winds and hail as it did.  Hail was not the major mode of severe weather.  Most of the larger hail occurred during the early stages of the storm.  Golf ball size hail fell west of Graettinger in Palo Alto County for the largest hail report.  The cluster of storms organized into a small derecho as it approached Fort Dodge.  The derecho raced southeast through the Des Moines area and into southeast Iowa.  It produced some hail as it did, but by in large high winds were the primary threat.  Winds of 60 to 75 MPH were common, causing considerable tree damage.  High winds of 65 to 75 MPH roared through Ames.  A shelter at the Iowa State Veterinary Medicine School was blown over.  Several horses were injured by the collapse.  University officials has to euthanize one horse due to severe injuries.  A measured wind gust of 84 MPH was recorded on the northwest side of the Des Moines Metro area.  Power was knocked out to nearly 40,000 customers in central Iowa by the storms.  Damage reports from along the path of the derecho were widespread.

The first round of storms flared up around midnight, in a northwest-southeast corridor stretching from Dawson County to Franklin County. These storms initiated along a rather subtle low to mid level convergence zone, in a very unstable airmass featuring 4000-5000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear. Severe weather reports included estimated wind gusts to 60 MPH, and hail up to quarter size, along with locally heavy rainfall.   Following a lull that lasted through the day, the evening hours brought one of the most significant severe weather episodes of the summer to the area, as a concentrated swath of damaging 60-90 MPH wind gusts swept eastward along and near the Interstate 80 corridor. These severe storms actually resulted from a merger between storms moving east from Southwest Nebraska, and other storms dropping south from North Central Nebraska. These initial storms developed in closer proximity to a surface cold front and trough axis, trailing southward from low pressure centered over the Dakotas. Around sunset, these smaller storm clusters merged as they entered Dawson and Buffalo Counties, quickly evolving into a forward-propagating mesoscale convective system (MCS) with damaging outflow winds. As storms first entered South Central Nebraska, the mesoscale environment featured 3000-4500 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and around 30 knots of deep-layer vertical shear. Over the course of around 3 hours, wind damage was widespread near the Interstate 80 corridor, but especially within Buffalo County, where gusts estimated as high as 90 MPH resulted in numerous damage reports.

A very unstable air mass was present over South Texas (CAPE values from 4500 to 5500 J/kg).  At 7 pm CDT, the first line of thunderstorms entered the Rio Grande Valley and produced hail up to the size of nickels, localized flooding and strong winds.  The second line of thunderstorms extended across much of Central Texas and began accelerating and tracking southward from Tilden to Goliad by late in the evening.  The two lines of thunderstorms merged around Tilden and Choke Canyon Reservoir near 1000 pm CDT causing intensification to the convective complex of storms.  This was evident by severe storms over Live Oak and Bee counties with increased reflectivity and cloud to ground lightning between 1030 and 1100 pm CDT.  At the same time, the northern line of thunderstorms continued through the Victoria Crossroads area and slowly weakened.  The strongest portion of the solid line of thunderstorms continued southeastward into the central Coastal Bend. Reports of trees down and power outages increased from along I-37 to Corpus Christi from the most intense portion of the line of thunderstorms.  WSR-88D detected small areas of rotation over Aransas, San Patricio and Nueces Counties between 1100 and  midnight CDT when tornado warnings were issued.  Wind gusts of 60 mph were common from automated weather stations as the storms slammed the lower Coastal Bend.  Power outages from the wind were significant by midnight and there were many reports of trees and power lines down, and rescue operations for recreational trailers that were tipped over on the base of Navy Corpus Christi and a flipped 18-wheeler. In this area, automated sensors measured wind as high as 80 mph.  The lightning was intense and continuous at times, which caused additional damage to a few structures. The line of thunderstorms produced widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain across South Texas with locally higher amounts. Total cloud to ground lightning strikes observed by the National Lightning Detection Network were near 38,000 from 800 pm to 200 am CDT.

As a result, there was little in the way of hail.  The downdraft CAPE was quite high, 800 to 1400 J/kg.  Thunderstorms formed in northeast Nebraska.  They rapidly formed into an upscale MCS, and eventually a full-fledged MCC.  Precipitable water values were extremely high, in the 2.5 to 2.75 inch range.  The primary mode of severe weather with the system was in the form of high wind.  Wind gusts of 60 to 70 MPH caused sporadic damage across western into central Iowa with tree damage, as well as damage to outbuildings.  The storms produced one funnel cloud in Carroll County.  The high precipitable water values led to very heavy rainfall with widespread flash flooding.  A swath of 2 to 5 inch rainfall extended from west central, through central, into parts of southeast Iowa.  There were numerous reports of a foot or more of flowing water over streets.  Following the flash flooding, water remained standing on many roads due to the soils across the state being nearly saturated.  This resulted in some road closures.  The Des Moines metropolitan area was hard hit as 3 to 5 inches of rain fell in 4 hours or less.  This caused extensive flooding in the city.  Some evacuations took place.  One was at a trailer court along Four Mile Creek on the east side of Des Moines.  Numerous roads were closed on the west side as well as Walnut Creek jumped its banks.

With surface dewpoints pushing the low 70s in many areas, the airmass was quite unstable as storms organized, with MLCAPE values into the 3000-4000 J/kg range. A few of these initial storms were supercells, with one producing a brief EF0 tornado shortly after nightfall in central Gosper County with no damage reported.

Southern Adams County was one of the hardest hit areas, with grain bins blown onto railroad tracks in Ayr, and signficant tree damage and some structural damage just north of Ayr at Crystal Lake. As this intial wave of storms weakened somewhat, another severe squall line surged into western sections of South Central Nebraska after midnight, aided by strong convergence along the nose of a 40-50 knot low level jet. With this line of late-night storms, damaging winds were not only reported along the leading edge of the outflow, but also in association with a wake low pressure system that developed behind the main squall line. These winds associated with the wake low pounded western Dawson County for several minutes, with reports of uprooted trees and damage to signs and a gazebo in Cozad.

Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas.  Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.  During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.  The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.  During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.  More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic.   By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storms fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted.   While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives.   Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes.

The second area was ahead of a cold front over north central North Dakota, where an isolated tornadic supercell developed and spawned an EF3 tornado near Bowbells.   Well into this event, Severe Thunderstorm Watch number 605 was issued across southwest and south central North Dakota in anticipation of a Mesoscale Convective System over southwest North Dakota tracking eastward along the South Dakota border area.  By the time of the watch issuance, the tornadic supercell over north central North Dakota had dissipated.  Multiple severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings were issued. Several reports of large hail, numerous reports of strong thunderstorm winds, and one confirmed EF3 tornado was received during this episode.   The EF3 tornado tragically claimed one fatality.

The first area was near a stationary boundary across southern North Dakota, where intense thunderstorm winds of 80 to near 100 mph were observed. The second area was ahead of a cold front over north central North Dakota, where an isolated tornadic supercell developed and spawned an EF3 tornado near Bowbells.
