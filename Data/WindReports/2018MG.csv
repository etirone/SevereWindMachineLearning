During the mid to late-afternoon hours Thursday, scattered thunderstorms developed from the Nebraska Panhandle down into northeast Colorado. Storm mergers, and an increasing number of storms, resulted in the formation of a squall line by 700 PM CST. This line of storms crossed most of south central Nebraska between 10 PM CST on the 10th and 1 AM CST on the 11th. These storms produced widespread measured gusts between 58 and 70 mph along the entire way across south central Nebraska from the Interstate 80 corridor south to Highway 6. A couple unofficial weather stations measured higher wind speeds including 80 mph near Axtell and 78 near Norman, both in Kearney County. Despite the coverage and magnitude of the winds, damage was only reported in a few spots. Tree branches were snapped off in Minden, an irrigation pivot was overturned near Glenvil, a few trees were blown down in Central City, and six utility poles were blown down or snapped off near Harvard. There were reports in southern Adams County and western Clay County of zero visibility in blowing dust as the high winds from the outflow moved in before the rain fell. Farmers had been preparing the fields for planting. So, top soil was loose and available for easy lofting and transport. Behind the squall line, other scattered thunderstorms developed. The strongest storms moved east along the entire length of Interstate 80 from Lexington to York between 1230 AM and 330 AM CST. These storms were mostly sub-severe, but there was a single report of one inch hail in Kearney at 2 AM CST.  During the morning hours of Thursday, a strong southward-moving cold front crossed Nebraska and became stationary along the northern Kansas border. A low pressure center formed over Wyoming and, by early evening, began moving east along the front. Meanwhile, chilly high pressure moved from the Canadian Prairies into the Great Lakes region. A broad upper-level ridge was over the Plains with a trough along the East Coast and another trough advancing through the western states. MUCAPE was around 1500 J/kg immediately preceding the storms. These storms formed on the northeast fringe of an elevated mixed layer that was advecting into the region, ahead of the western trough. Deep layer shear was 50 kts and greater. This environment was more than sufficient for severe thunderstorms. The cold pool associated with the squall line was strong.

The first round of storms left an outflow boundary across southeast Missouri and the lower Ohio Valley, where scattered thunderstorms developed. Surface dewpoints near the boundary were in the lower 70s, which contributed to moderately strong instability.

758514,6/2/2018 5:46,50,MG,This peak wind gust was recorded from a personal weather station located 4 miles east of Pauline.,"June kicked off with a round of active weather on this Friday evening, as a squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) tracked across the majority of South Central Nebraska from north-to-south. Fortunately, severe weather reports were fairly limited in number and primarily concentrated within northern counties, with convection exhibiting a gradually-weakening trend as it sank south of the Interstate 80 corridor. Among the highlights of this event included a brief tornado just east of Ord, ping pong ball size hail near Loup City, and numerous broken tree branches up to 6 inches in diameter near Shelby. This storm complex was largely non-severe farther south, although a mesonet station in southwestern Clay County managed to clock an isolated 58 MPH gust.   As for timing, the initial severe storms of the afternoon/early-evening developed slightly north of the local area, and it wasnt until 830-930 p.m. CDT that quasi-linear convection entered Valley/Sherman/Greeley counties. Over the next few hours, this squall line expanded farther southwest, while also becoming more west-east oriented and gradually losing overall-intensity. Eventually, between 230-330 a.m. CDT on the 2nd, storms departed into Kansas from far southeastern local counties such as Nuckolls/Thayer. From a meteorological perspective, this was a fairly classic late-spring severe weather setup. In the mid-upper levels, a shortwave trough tracked from the northern/central Rockies toward the Dakotas between the 1st and the 2nd, with Nebraska along the southern periphery of strongest forcing. At the surface, Nebraska resided in between primary low pressure centers during the evening, with one mainly over ND and the other in western KS. Severe storms initially developed along a pre-frontal trough, with the actual north-south oriented cold front passing through South Central Nebraska during the overnight hours. Ahead of these boundaries, a very unstable airmass developed locally, with early evening temperatures around 90 F and dewpoints around 70 F yielding mixed-layer CAPE around 3000 J/kg. Combined with moderate deep-layer (0-6 km) shear of 30-40 knots and a strengthening nocturnal low level jet of 40+ knots, this was a somewhat volatile environment for severe weather. However, overall storm severity ended up underachieving somewhat locally. For one thing, the early-onset of a linear storm mode likely muted the large hail threat. Secondly, the more concentrated swath of severe-criteria winds ended up targeting eastern Nebraska more so than south central parts of the state.",40.42,-98.26

For most places though, storms were fairly weak, producing only rainfall and modest wind gusts. However, there were two glaring and rather localized exceptions featuring ground-truth of severe wind gusts, one in the far northeast portion of the local area and the other in the southwest. More specifically, around 815 p.m. CDT on the 6th, a southward-surging outflow boundary with estimated wind gusts to 70 MPH destroyed a metal outbuilding a few miles northeast of Osceola (northwest of Shelby). Then several hours later, shortly after 3 a.m. CDT on the 7th, a surge of very intense winds along a bowing line segment (measured at 91 MPH on a personal weather station) caused considerable damage in a small portion of western Harlan County between Orleans and Oxford, including: uprooted trees, overturned pivots and windows blown out of a home.  Breaking down the evolution of thunderstorms over the course of this time frame, things first initiated in far northeast portions of the local area during the mid-afternoon and late-evening hours. As early as around 4 p.m. CDT, an isolated storm produced nickel size hail near Fullerton. While this early activity faded quickly, a few hours later a cluster of severe storms developed slightly north of Polk/Nance counties, with the resultant southward-surging outflow causing the Polk County damage before sunset. Interestingly, this damage occurred at least 5-10 miles south of the leading edge of any rainfall. During the next few hours, until around 11 p.m. CDT, a northwest-southeast oriented line of strong storms continued affecting mainly Nance and northern Greeley counties, but there were no additional severe-criteria reports. As the pre-midnight activity was occurring in the northeast, a separate cluster of strong to severe storms developed well off to the west in the Nebraska-Colorado-Kansas border region, eventually tracking into far southwestern portions of the local area between midnight-1 a.m. CDT in the form of a linear mesoscale convective system (MCS). Although the majority of severe-criteria wind gusts associated with this complex focused just to the south within northwest/north central Kansas, a northward-surging bow in the convective line developed rather abruptly over southwestern Harlan County around 2:30 a.m. CDT. This small-scale feature soon caused the aforementioned, extensive-but-localized damage in west-central Harlan County. Winds diminished in intensity as they swept north into Phelps County, but a mesonet station north-northwest of Holdrege still managed a 58 MPH gust at 3:41 a.m. CDT. This was the last severe weather report of the day, as convection steadily weakened and diminished in coverage through the mid-morning hours.  In the mid-upper levels, these events of the 6th-7th occurred in a subtly-forced environment, as Nebraska resided under weak westerly flow along the northern periphery of a ridge extending up from the Southern Plains. As a result, deep-layer wind shear was weak, only averaging around 25 knots or less. However, there was plentiful instability, as the combination of afternoon temperatures in the 90s F and dewpoints well into the 60s F yielded mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon/early-evening. At the surface, this activity occurred to the south of a west-east oriented, quasi-stationary front draped through northern Nebraska.",40.5035,-99.3991

Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan.   When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.  Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.  Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon. While the late-afternoon and evening storms were well-anticipated, if anything was a bit of a forecast surprise it was the early formation of the pair of intense supercells, which could have posed a more dire tornado threat had they tracked directly along the surface front instead of generally 10-20 miles north of it.",40.67,-97.62

One large limb, approximately 1 foot in diameter, was downed.","A mesoscale convective system produced pockets of high winds and wind damage just after midnight on this Saturday morning. During the evening hours of Friday, scattered small clusters of multi-cell thunderstorms occurred over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The clusters over southwest Nebraska were moving to the east and the clusters over northwest Kansas were moving northeast. Between 10 and 11 PM CST, as these two areas of thunderstorms, and their outflows, began to merge, thunderstorm coverage began to increase as new thunderstorms formed between McCook and Lexington. The increase in coverage resulted in storm mergers and the formation of a larger multicell mesoscale convective system. Between 11 PM and 12 AM CST, the orientation of the MCS temporarily became northeast to southwest as new cells continued to develop along the Platte River. The MCS then morphed more into a circular shape as it moved northeast along Highway 30 from Grand Island to Columbus. Initially, some low-end severe hail occurred in parts of Furnas and Phelps counties, but as the MCS matured, severe winds became dominant. Powerful downburst winds occurred in portions of Kearney, Adams, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. The highest measured wind gust was 69 mph at a home weather station near the town of Norman. Other measured gusts included 58 mph at the Grand Island airport and 60 mph at the Hastings airport. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 57 mph occurred surrounding these areas and even far away from where the thunderstorms actually occurred. Winds were measured at 50 mph as far south as Red Cloud. Large tree limbs were snapped off in some spots around Grand Island and in Central City. Near the Platte River, just south of Central City, large tree limbs fell on a house and landed on top of vehicles.  These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from California to Maine and low in amplitude. There was no strong forcing aloft affecting the Central Plains. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, near 8.5 C/km. This resulted in very high instability with MUCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 30 kt.  This thunderstorm event was the first of several episodes of heavy rain which led to a very wet start of September for portions of south central Nebraska. Later in the evening on this Saturday, waves of thunderstorms formed over north central Kansas and repeatedly moved northeast into south central Nebraska with the greatest persistence south and east of Hastings. These waves of heavy rain continued through the night. There was a break from heavy rain during the day Sunday, but the next episode of heavy rain moved in Sunday evening. By daybreak on Monday, September 3rd, rainfall amounts totaled 3 to 5 inches across portions of northern Franklin, southern Adams, and southern Clay counties, as well as most of Fillmore, Webster, Nuckolls, and Thayer counties. This resulted in localized flash flooding with low spots in some county roads being washed out and Highway 4 being closed between Carleton and Davenport.

The emergency manager also reported an accident just south on Interstate 80 that was possibly weather related. A nearby observation at the Kearney Airport recorded a measured wind gust of 59 MPH at 1:59 AM CDT at the same time of the wind damage. There was also a public report of an estimated 60 mph wind gust was reported 3 miles south of Gibbon at the Windmill State Recreation Area.,"The very early morning hours on this Saturday featured a number of severe-criteria wind gusts across primarily the northeast half of South Central Nebraska, thanks to a squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) racing through from northwest-to-southeast. The strongest-known measured wind was 74 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island, shortly before 2 a.m. CDT. Other notable measured wind gusts included: 64 MPH at Ord airport, 62 MPH at both Hastings and York airports, and 59 MPH at Kearney airport. Ground-truth damage reports were fairly limited, but a cooperative observer near Shelby reported 7 diameter tree limbs down, and several overturned irrigation pivots in the area. In addition, a power line was downed by a fallen tree in Shelton, and power was also knocked out for a time in Red Cloud. This was almost purely a wind event, with storms producing little-to-no-hail, and the vast majority of severe gusts concentrating east-northeast of a line from western Buffalo County to Webster County.   Timing-wise, the leading edge of the squall line entered the far northern local area (Valley County) shortly after midnight CDT, with outflow winds surging several miles out ahead of the trailing precipitation core. Severe winds reached the Highway 30 corridor around 2 a.m. CDT, and a line from roughly Hastings-York by around 2:30 a.m. CDT. The last evidence of severe weather within the local area consisted of 60 MPH winds at a mesonet station near Nelson at 319 a.m. CDT. Well before reaching South Central Nebraska, the initial severe convection that eventually morphed into this fast-moving squall line developed over south central South Dakota during the late afternoon/early evening of the 8th. In the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly classic setup for nocturnal severe weather. While forcing was not overly-strong, a low-amplitude disturbance tracked across mainly northern NE/southern SD through the night, embedded within a broad, quasi-zonal flow regime. Once the afternoon/early evening storms over southern SD grew upscale into an organized MCS, southeastward propagation into the local area was fostered by a southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) strengthening to 30-40 knots. Around the time convection surged into northern local counties, mesoscale parameters featured around 1000-2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and moderate deep-layer (0-6 km) shear of 30-40 knots.",40.78,-98.73

Storm mergers, and an increasing number of storms, resulted in the formation of a squall line by 700 PM CST. This line of storms crossed most of south central Nebraska between 10 PM CST on the 10th and 1 AM CST on the 11th. These storms produced widespread measured gusts between 58 and 70 mph along the entire way across south central Nebraska from the Interstate 80 corridor south to Highway 6. A couple unofficial weather stations measured higher wind speeds including 80 mph near Axtell and 78 near Norman, both in Kearney County. Despite the coverage and magnitude of the winds, damage was only reported in a few spots. Tree branches were snapped off in Minden, an irrigation pivot was overturned near Glenvil, a few trees were blown down in Central City, and six utility poles were blown down or snapped off near Harvard. There were reports in southern Adams County and western Clay County of zero visibility in blowing dust as the high winds from the outflow moved in before the rain fell. Farmers had been preparing the fields for planting. So, top soil was loose and available for easy lofting and transport. Behind the squall line, other scattered thunderstorms developed. The strongest storms moved east along the entire length of Interstate 80 from Lexington to York between 1230 AM and 330 AM CST. These storms were mostly sub-severe, but there was a single report of one inch hail in Kearney at 2 AM CST.  During the morning hours of Thursday, a strong southward-moving cold front crossed Nebraska and became stationary along the northern Kansas border. A low pressure center formed over Wyoming and, by early evening, began moving east along the front. Meanwhile, chilly high pressure moved from the Canadian Prairies into the Great Lakes region. A broad upper-level ridge was over the Plains with a trough along the East Coast and another trough advancing through the western states. MUCAPE was around 1500 J/kg immediately preceding the storms. These storms formed on the northeast fringe of an elevated mixed layer that was advecting into the region, ahead of the western trough. Deep layer shear was 50 kts and greater. This environment was more than sufficient for severe thunderstorms. The cold pool associated with the squall line was strong. The temperature at Lexington dropped 16 deg F in 20 minutes (76 to 60 deg F) as the gust front moved through, and 23 deg in 40 min (76 to 53 deg F).",40.7645,-98.3523

There were several reports of large hail (up to baseball size), damaging winds (up to around 70 MPH), a few pockets of very heavy rainfall into mainly the 3-5 range, and one brief EF-0 tornado. This tornado, which exhibited multi-vortex structure along its short path, was caught on video by a storm chaser near Huntley in eastern Harlan County around 5:45 p.m. CDT. Shortly before dropping the tornado, this high-precipitation (HP) supercell storm also yielded tennis ball to baseball size hail several miles north of Orleans. Other notable hail reports on this day included 2 diameter stones near Franklin and ping pong ball size near Blue Hill. As for damaging winds, the highest measured gusts (unofficial sources) featured 71 MPH near Carleton and 63 MPH near Holbrook. At least minor tree/branch damage was reported in or near Cambridge and Naponee, and power lines were blown down near Republican City. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the 24-county area received at least 1 of mostly-welcomed rainfall. However, there were generally four distinct zones that got drenched with noticeably higher amounts of at least 3-4, and locally more. These included portions of the following counties: much of southern/eastern Thayer; much of northern Furnas and adjacent portions of Gosper/Phelps/Harlan; parts of northern Nuckolls/southern Clay; and parts of northeastern York. A few of the highest official 24-hour totals (NWS coop and CoCoRaHS observers) featured: 5.14 northeast of Chester, 4.52 near Deweese, 3.86 in Edison and 3.80 in Hubbell. There was also an unofficial report of a whopping 7 south of Gilead in far southeast Thayer County. Although there were surely several instances of fairly minor flooding and even brief flash flooding, ground truth reports were rather limited.   Breaking down event evolution/timing, the first strong to severe storms of the afternoon fired up between 3:30-5:00 p.m. CDT on opposite ends of the local area, with one cluster in Thayer County and the other centered over Furnas County. During the next couple hours, intense multicell convection gradually connected the gap between the original two clusters, eventually resulting in one semi-organized band. However, during this same time, the most intense storm of the day took center stage as an embedded HP supercell tracked across much of Harlan and southern Franklin counties, producing very large hail and the aforementioned brief tornado. Between 7 p.m. CDT and nightfall, convection expanded in areal coverage to encompass most all of South Central Nebraska, while the overall severe weather threat diminished. However, around 9 p.m. CDT another cluster of vigorous convection rolled in from the west, yielding a few reports of marginally-severe winds in Furnas County. These were the last severe reports of the evening, with only a large shield of mainly light to moderate rain persisting well past midnight, while gradually ending from west-to-east.   Closing with some meteorological background, this was a well-anticipated round of severe storms and heavy rainfall, as low-amplitude shortwave energy tracked into Nebraska around the southeast periphery of a larger-scale trough/closed low centered over the Northern Rockies.

770431,6/30/2018 22:24,51,MG,nan,"Especially for counties south of Interstate 80 in South Central Nebraska, June finished with an active Saturday afternoon and evening of severe storms. Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan.   When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.  Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.  Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon. While the late-afternoon and evening storms were well-anticipated, if anything was a bit of a forecast surprise it was the early formation of the pair of intense supercells, which could have posed a more dire tornado threat had they tracked directly along the surface front instead of generally 10-20 miles north of it.",40.5,-98.78

While they were initially supercells, these storms weakened from destructive interference as they moved south-southeast. One storm did produce a little nickel size hail over southwest Valley county around 7 PM CST. The main show was an incredible supercell that developed near Mason City around that time. The storm moved across Sherman, Buffalo, and Kearney counties over the following 2 hours, and put on a spectacular lightning and cloud-structure show. The storm was all by itself. People were taking pictures of the storm as far away as Harlan County Lake. This storm produced hail up to the size of golf balls from near Litchfield all the way down to just east of Kearney. There were spotty areas of crop damage, from hail and wind, along the way. The largest hail was the size of baseballs in Hazard, but there must have been a small number as there was very little damage visible the following day. The storm probably remained severe into northern Kearney county, but no additional reports were received south of I-80. The storm then weakened after 9 PM CST. Another storm moved out of Custer county and into Valley county just after 8 PM CST. This storm moved along nearly the identical path of the first storm. The most intense portion of this storm was during its journey through eastern Buffalo county. Golf ball size hail was reported between Kearney and Gibbon at 950 PM CST. Because these storms affected the same area of Buffalo county, there is uncertainty on which storm produced the crop damage. These storms weakened and dissipated during the late evening hours.

These storms were mostly sub-severe, but there was a single report of one inch hail in Kearney at 2 AM CST.  During the morning hours of Thursday, a strong southward-moving cold front crossed Nebraska and became stationary along the northern Kansas border. A low pressure center formed over Wyoming and, by early evening, began moving east along the front. Meanwhile, chilly high pressure moved from the Canadian Prairies into the Great Lakes region. A broad upper-level ridge was over the Plains with a trough along the East Coast and another trough advancing through the western states. MUCAPE was around 1500 J/kg immediately preceding the storms. These storms formed on the northeast fringe of an elevated mixed layer that was advecting into the region, ahead of the western trough. Deep layer shear was 50 kts and greater. This environment was more than sufficient for severe thunderstorms. The cold pool associated with the squall line was strong. The temperature at Lexington dropped 16 deg F in 20 minutes (76 to 60 deg F) as the gust front moved through, and 23 deg in 40 min (76 to 53 deg F).",40.4609,-97.6662

This is a continuation of the severe thunderstorm wind gust swath from Hale County.,"On the afternoon of the 15th, a cold front pushed into the southern South Plains initially developing thunderstorms in the Permian Basin. However, strong instability north of the frontal boundary combined with an advancing short wave in New Mexico brought significant severe convection to the South Plains and extreme southern Texas Panhandle. Initially, thunderstorms brought severe hail to the area. Crosbyton (Crosby County) took the brunt of the damage with widespread damage reports in the town due to wind-driven baseball size hail. An NWS storm survey the next day revealed numerous south facing windows on buildings destroyed along with many totaled vehicles. In Abernathy (Hale County), penny to quarter size hail completely covered Interstate-27. As the evening progressed, storms moving into the area from New Mexico primarily created severe wind gusts. A large swath of wind gusts spanned from western Hale County into central Floyd County.

Other areas reported 100 degrees in southern Minnesota, including Mankato.   The heat and humidity was the source of an unstable atmosphere across Minnesota. An earlier outflow boundary from thunderstorms in Wisconsin, moved westward and ignited a broken line of thunderstorms in northern Iowa, and southern Minnesota, south of Mankato, prior to 2 pm. These storms produced an outflow boundary and raced northward toward the Twin Cities metro area. Thunderstorms continued to form along the outflow boundary and a few caused severe hail, and damaging wind gusts. The largest hail stone was reported near Avon, where 2 inch diameter hail was observed and recorded on video.

By the mid to late afternoon, temperatures rose into the 90s with CAPE values of 1500-2000 J/Kg. Due to weak wind shear, most of the storms were outflow dominant, but occasional severe wind gusts occurred with the stronger cores. Two storms produced significant wind damage near Geneva, north of Albert Lea, Minnesota, and Hutchinson, Minnesota. A turkey barn was destroyed near Geneva, and three people were injured but recovered from their injuries. Around Hutchinson, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines. Some of the trees caused damage to homes.  The local emergency manager in McLeod County determined that there were about 5-6 houses in Hutchinson that received structural damage from trees.  In addition, McLeod County declared a state of emergency on May 30, 2018 as a result of these high winds. An initial damage assessment was conducted and determined that there was about $54,000 in estimated public assistance damages.  Other storms produced an occasional hail stone up to quarter size.

759190,6/9/2018 8:19,52,MG,nan,"The very early morning hours on this Saturday featured a number of severe-criteria wind gusts across primarily the northeast half of South Central Nebraska, thanks to a squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) racing through from northwest-to-southeast. The strongest-known measured wind was 74 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island, shortly before 2 a.m. CDT. Other notable measured wind gusts included: 64 MPH at Ord airport, 62 MPH at both Hastings and York airports, and 59 MPH at Kearney airport. Ground-truth damage reports were fairly limited, but a cooperative observer near Shelby reported 7 diameter tree limbs down, and several overturned irrigation pivots in the area. In addition, a power line was downed by a fallen tree in Shelton, and power was also knocked out for a time in Red Cloud. This was almost purely a wind event, with storms producing little-to-no-hail, and the vast majority of severe gusts concentrating east-northeast of a line from western Buffalo County to Webster County.   Timing-wise, the leading edge of the squall line entered the far northern local area (Valley County) shortly after midnight CDT, with outflow winds surging several miles out ahead of the trailing precipitation core. Severe winds reached the Highway 30 corridor around 2 a.m. CDT, and a line from roughly Hastings-York by around 2:30 a.m. CDT. The last evidence of severe weather within the local area consisted of 60 MPH winds at a mesonet station near Nelson at 319 a.m. CDT. Well before reaching South Central Nebraska, the initial severe convection that eventually morphed into this fast-moving squall line developed over south central South Dakota during the late afternoon/early evening of the 8th. In the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly classic setup for nocturnal severe weather. While forcing was not overly-strong, a low-amplitude disturbance tracked across mainly northern NE/southern SD through the night, embedded within a broad, quasi-zonal flow regime. Once the afternoon/early evening storms over southern SD grew upscale into an organized MCS, southeastward propagation into the local area was fostered by a southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) strengthening to 30-40 knots. Around the time convection surged into northern local counties, mesoscale parameters featured around 1000-2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and moderate deep-layer (0-6 km) shear of 30-40 knots.",40.2145,-98.07

In the lower levels, high low level moisture was in place with moderate to strong south to southeasterly surface winds. A surface boundary also set up from southwest to northeast across the Panhandles along with an outflow boundary moving west from western Oklahoma. These boundary set ups provided good shear with the already high instability across the region. As a result in the afternoon hours, slow moving supercells were developing across parts of the central and eastern Texas Panhandles. One storm near Panhandle, TX did produce a brief tornado. More thunderstorms would fire into the evening hours across portions of the western Texas Panhandle as the main boundary moved westward. A second complex of thunderstorms developed across portions of the eastern OK Panhandle in association with a complex of storms developing just to the east of Beaver County, OK.

761539,6/20/2018 2:27,52,MG,nan,"This was an active Tuesday afternoon and evening of thunderstorms across much of South Central Nebraska, although all verified severe weather concentrated within counties south of Interstate 80. There were several reports of large hail (up to baseball size), damaging winds (up to around 70 MPH), a few pockets of very heavy rainfall into mainly the 3-5 range, and one brief EF-0 tornado. This tornado, which exhibited multi-vortex structure along its short path, was caught on video by a storm chaser near Huntley in eastern Harlan County around 5:45 p.m. CDT. Shortly before dropping the tornado, this high-precipitation (HP) supercell storm also yielded tennis ball to baseball size hail several miles north of Orleans. Other notable hail reports on this day included 2 diameter stones near Franklin and ping pong ball size near Blue Hill. As for damaging winds, the highest measured gusts (unofficial sources) featured 71 MPH near Carleton and 63 MPH near Holbrook. At least minor tree/branch damage was reported in or near Cambridge and Naponee, and power lines were blown down near Republican City. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the 24-county area received at least 1 of mostly-welcomed rainfall. However, there were generally four distinct zones that got drenched with noticeably higher amounts of at least 3-4, and locally more. These included portions of the following counties: much of southern/eastern Thayer; much of northern Furnas and adjacent portions of Gosper/Phelps/Harlan; parts of northern Nuckolls/southern Clay; and parts of northeastern York. A few of the highest official 24-hour totals (NWS coop and CoCoRaHS observers) featured: 5.14 northeast of Chester, 4.52 near Deweese, 3.86 in Edison and 3.80 in Hubbell. There was also an unofficial report of a whopping 7 south of Gilead in far southeast Thayer County. Although there were surely several instances of fairly minor flooding and even brief flash flooding, ground truth reports were rather limited.   Breaking down event evolution/timing, the first strong to severe storms of the afternoon fired up between 3:30-5:00 p.m. CDT on opposite ends of the local area, with one cluster in Thayer County and the other centered over Furnas County. During the next couple hours, intense multicell convection gradually connected the gap between the original two clusters, eventually resulting in one semi-organized band. However, during this same time, the most intense storm of the day took center stage as an embedded HP supercell tracked across much of Harlan and southern Franklin counties, producing very large hail and the aforementioned brief tornado. Between 7 p.m. CDT and nightfall, convection expanded in areal coverage to encompass most all of South Central Nebraska, while the overall severe weather threat diminished. However, around 9 p.m. CDT another cluster of vigorous convection rolled in from the west, yielding a few reports of marginally-severe winds in Furnas County. These were the last severe reports of the evening, with only a large shield of mainly light to moderate rain persisting well past midnight, while gradually ending from west-to-east.   Closing with some meteorological background, this was a well-anticipated round of severe storms and heavy rainfall, as low-amplitude shortwave energy tracked into Nebraska around the southeast periphery of a larger-scale trough/closed low centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a fairly well-defined and generally west-east oriented quasi-stationary front stretched near the Nebraska-Kansas-border, with the majority of South Central Nebraska residing just north of this boundary in an environment characterized by east-northeast breezes, afternoon temperatures in the 80s F and dewpoints in the upper 60s-low 70s F.

As this complex moved east, another area of prolonged thunderstorm activity behind the cold front was occurring over Graham County where several hours of heavy rainfall had occurred.  The many hours of prolonged rainfall added up to between four and six inches of rain for the northern half of Graham County, which lead to flash flooding in Hill City.

771082,7/1/2018 5:00,52,MG,A 60 mph wind gust was recorded three miles south of Geneva.,"Especially for counties south of Interstate 80 in South Central Nebraska, June finished with an active Saturday afternoon and evening of severe storms. Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan.   When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.  Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.  Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon. While the late-afternoon and evening storms were well-anticipated, if anything was a bit of a forecast surprise it was the early formation of the pair of intense supercells, which could have posed a more dire tornado threat had they tracked directly along the surface front instead of generally 10-20 miles north of it.",40.48,-97.6

766898,8/7/2018 1:15,52,MG,This wind gust actually occurred at the York Airport (the latitude/longitude is correct).,"This Monday evening got somewhat more active than anticipated, as a pair of supercell storms affected mainly the northeast quadrant of South Central Nebraska, resulting in several reports of large hail (up to 2 diameter), damaging winds (up to around 75 MPH), and even one EF-1 tornado. This tornado (spawned by the eastern supercell) touched down in northwestern York County around 7:45 p.m. CDT and tracked east-southeast for less than 2 miles, causing minor damage to a home while also damaging several grain bins and snapping a few large trees. The largest hail reports (2) originated from the Bradshaw and Alda areas. In addition, golf ball size hail occurred near Benedict and Waco, and much of the city of York saw a few minutes of hail to at least half dollar size. As for thunderstorm winds, the highest measured gust was 60 MPH at the York airport. However, especially the eastern supercell produced a concentrated swath of damaging winds, estimated to around 75 MPH in some places. Crop damage (from a combo of both hail/wind) was extensive along this storms track from central Merrick County into northeastern Hamilton County and northwestern-through-east-central York County.   Taking a closer look at event evolution/timing, a smattering of weak, elevated storms got underway as early as early-mid afternoon across various parts of the 24-county area, producing little more than brief downpours and small hail. By late afternoon, another round of fairly weak storms flared up within counties mainly north of Interstate 80. However, between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, the situation escalated as one of these initially-weak storms rapidly became severe over Howard County, becoming a legitimate supercell as it tracked east-southeast through parts of Merrick-northeastern Hamilton and York counties. This storm yielded the majority of local severe weather reports/damage (including the York County tornado), before exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after 8:30 p.m. CDT. Meanwhile, back to the west, another supercell initiated over far northeastern Buffalo County around 8 p.m. CDT. Like its predecessor, it also tracked east-southeast for a few hours,  producing large hail in the Alda and Stockham areas before weakening over northern Fillmore County around 10 p.m. CDT. Thereafter, non-severe storms continued percolating well into the night within areas mainly south of Interstate 80 and east of Highway 281, with all of South Central Nebraska finally storm-free by 3 a.m. CDT on the 7th.   In hindsight, this was actually a decent setup for supercell storm development. However, right up until the early evening hours, locations as far north as Merrick/York counties seemed somewhat unfavorable for higher-end severe potential, especially given that the primary west-east oriented surface front resided well to the south over northern Kansas. However, even in the post-frontal airmass over South Central Nebraska, the combo of afternoon high temperatures into the 80s F and dewpoints in the upper 60s-low 70s F promoted mixed-layer CAPE around 2000 J/kg. This healthy instability, in tandem with seasonably-strong deep-layer wind shear of 40-50 knots and modest forcing provided by a shortwave trough invading from the northwest, proved plenty-sufficient to support a few supercells.",40.8964,-97.6242

778034,9/1/2018 6:34,52,MG,nan,"A mesoscale convective system produced pockets of high winds and wind damage just after midnight on this Saturday morning. During the evening hours of Friday, scattered small clusters of multi-cell thunderstorms occurred over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The clusters over southwest Nebraska were moving to the east and the clusters over northwest Kansas were moving northeast. Between 10 and 11 PM CST, as these two areas of thunderstorms, and their outflows, began to merge, thunderstorm coverage began to increase as new thunderstorms formed between McCook and Lexington. The increase in coverage resulted in storm mergers and the formation of a larger multicell mesoscale convective system. Between 11 PM and 12 AM CST, the orientation of the MCS temporarily became northeast to southwest as new cells continued to develop along the Platte River. The MCS then morphed more into a circular shape as it moved northeast along Highway 30 from Grand Island to Columbus. Initially, some low-end severe hail occurred in parts of Furnas and Phelps counties, but as the MCS matured, severe winds became dominant. Powerful downburst winds occurred in portions of Kearney, Adams, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. The highest measured wind gust was 69 mph at a home weather station near the town of Norman. Other measured gusts included 58 mph at the Grand Island airport and 60 mph at the Hastings airport. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 57 mph occurred surrounding these areas and even far away from where the thunderstorms actually occurred. Winds were measured at 50 mph as far south as Red Cloud. Large tree limbs were snapped off in some spots around Grand Island and in Central City. Near the Platte River, just south of Central City, large tree limbs fell on a house and landed on top of vehicles.  These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from California to Maine and low in amplitude. There was no strong forcing aloft affecting the Central Plains. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, near 8.5 C/km. This resulted in very high instability with MUCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 30 kt.  This thunderstorm event was the first of several episodes of heavy rain which led to a very wet start of September for portions of south central Nebraska. Later in the evening on this Saturday, waves of thunderstorms formed over north central Kansas and repeatedly moved northeast into south central Nebraska with the greatest persistence south and east of Hastings. These waves of heavy rain continued through the night. There was a break from heavy rain during the day Sunday, but the next episode of heavy rain moved in Sunday evening. By daybreak on Monday, September 3rd, rainfall amounts totaled 3 to 5 inches across portions of northern Franklin, southern Adams, and southern Clay counties, as well as most of Fillmore, Webster, Nuckolls, and Thayer counties. This resulted in localized flash flooding with low spots in some county roads being washed out and Highway 4 being closed between Carleton and Davenport.

These storms were part of a much larger line that extended from Souix Falls, South Dakota to Hill City, Kansas. Thunderstorms continued to increase in coverage, filling-in between Red Cloud and York. Between 4 and 6 PM CST, some storms became severe. While the majority of storms were still predominantly individual cells, hail occurred in a couple spots over Clay and Webster counties. The largest hail reported was the size of ping pong balls and golf balls in the town of Cowles. Between 5 and 6 PM CST, a squall line formed from Highway 136 in Webster county down into north central Kansas. The northern portion of this line became a small-scale bow echo and moved northeast across Nuckolls, Thayer, and Fillmore counties. Damaging downburst winds snapped off large tree limbs in Red Cloud,  Hebron, and Bruning. Winds were measured at 64 MPH in Nelson and 65 MPH in Davenport.  In the preceding days, an east-west oriented front had become quasi-stationary from the Ohio Valley across central Nebraska to Nevada. During the morning hours on this date, a low formed on the front between North Platte and McCook. This low then accelerated to near Sioux City, Iowa by mid-afternoon with its trailing cold front becoming mobile and moving southeast. The storms formed along this front. In the upper-levels, a subtropical high was over the Tennessee Valley and gradually moved into the Carolinas as a fairly strong shortwave trough moved out of the Northern Rockies into Northern and Central Plains. Immediately ahead of the front, temperatures were in the lower to middle 90s with dewpoints in the lower to middle 60s. Combined with mid-level lapse rates between 7.0 and 7.5 C/km, SBCAPE was between 1500 and 2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was near 40 kt.",40.1342,-98.1782

Throughout the morning and early afternoon, a narrow band of light rain, oriented from southwest-northeast, moved from eastern Colorado into western Kansas. Skies were sunny ahead of this rain band and by mid-afternoon, scattered thunderstorms began forming at its leading edge. Around 330 PM CST, these storms began moving into Phillips county, and they were part of a larger line of storms that formed along or ahead of the rain band from Sioux Falls, South Dakota to Garden City, Kansas. This line of storms crossed north central Kansas between 330 and 630 PM CST. After 530 PM CST, enough storms had formed along the common cold pool to result in the formation of a squall line over Jewell and Mitchell counties. Most of the severe weather occurred from a single storm that produced damaging downburst winds over central and northeast Rooks county, and one inch hail in southwest Smith county. That storm occurred prior to the formation of the squall line. Winds were measured as high as 70 MPH at the airport just south of Stockton, and nearby power lines were downed across Highway 183 resulting in its closure for a time. Power lines were also knocked down in the city of Stockton and a tree was blown down near Woodston. Elsewhere, the only other severe weather was a measured wind gust of 60 MPH in Beloit as the squall line moved through the city, but winds between 50 and 55 mph were measured in multiple locations in Mitchell and Jewell counties.

While the storms were able to maintain their vigor, sub-severe to severe hail was seen through parts of Pocahontas, Humboldt, Wright, and Calhoun Counties before they weakened and eventually subsided entirely.   Later that afternoon, as the surface boundary entered the state, storms once again fired up across the northern to north central areas of the state. The convective environment across the western half or so of the state was quite ripe with as much as 5000 to 6000 J/kg MUCAPE. Effective shear was lacking, however, with predominantly 35 kts or less existing.  Hail CAPE approached 1000 J/kg and DCAPE to around 1400 J/kg respectively, indicating the potential for both severe hail and severe downdrafts even with the lackluster shear profile. Afternoon convection saw initial isolated and multi-cell clusters form with hail as the primary threat evolving into a QLCS with a primary wind threat by the mid-evening hours.

There were no known ground-truth reports of storm damage.   Digging into the details of this event a bit more, the storm complex that tracked across the local area actually resulted from the merger of two separate systems over northwest Kansas; one that had been moving southeastward from southwest Nebraska, and another that expanded northward out of southwest Kansas. Shortly after this merger, the resultant MCS entered Rooks/Phillips counties between 2-3 a.m. CDT, producing the aforementioned severe-criteria gusts. Storms exhibited a general weakening trend as they pushed across the remainder of the local area, but gusts to around 50 MPH continued until the main part of the line exited eastern Jewell/Mitchell counties around 5:30 a.m. CDT.

770432,7/1/2018 2:20,54,MG,nan,"Especially for counties south of Interstate 80 in South Central Nebraska, June finished with an active Saturday afternoon and evening of severe storms. Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan.   When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.  Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.  Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon. While the late-afternoon and evening storms were well-anticipated, if anything was a bit of a forecast surprise it was the early formation of the pair of intense supercells, which could have posed a more dire tornado threat had they tracked directly along the surface front instead of generally 10-20 miles north of it.",40.29,-100.11

771094,7/1/2018 5:07,54,MG,A 62 mph thunderstorm wind gust was recorded one mile east southeast of Fairmont.,"Especially for counties south of Interstate 80 in South Central Nebraska, June finished with an active Saturday afternoon and evening of severe storms. Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan.   When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg.

A few of the highest official 24-hour totals (NWS coop and CoCoRaHS observers) featured: 5.14 northeast of Chester, 4.52 near Deweese, 3.86 in Edison and 3.80 in Hubbell. There was also an unofficial report of a whopping 7 south of Gilead in far southeast Thayer County. Although there were surely several instances of fairly minor flooding and even brief flash flooding, ground truth reports were rather limited.   Breaking down event evolution/timing, the first strong to severe storms of the afternoon fired up between 3:30-5:00 p.m. CDT on opposite ends of the local area, with one cluster in Thayer County and the other centered over Furnas County. During the next couple hours, intense multicell convection gradually connected the gap between the original two clusters, eventually resulting in one semi-organized band. However, during this same time, the most intense storm of the day took center stage as an embedded HP supercell tracked across much of Harlan and southern Franklin counties, producing very large hail and the aforementioned brief tornado. Between 7 p.m. CDT and nightfall, convection expanded in areal coverage to encompass most all of South Central Nebraska, while the overall severe weather threat diminished. However, around 9 p.m. CDT another cluster of vigorous convection rolled in from the west, yielding a few reports of marginally-severe winds in Furnas County. These were the last severe reports of the evening, with only a large shield of mainly light to moderate rain persisting well past midnight, while gradually ending from west-to-east.   Closing with some meteorological background, this was a well-anticipated round of severe storms and heavy rainfall, as low-amplitude shortwave energy tracked into Nebraska around the southeast periphery of a larger-scale trough/closed low centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a fairly well-defined and generally west-east oriented quasi-stationary front stretched near the Nebraska-Kansas-border, with the majority of South Central Nebraska residing just north of this boundary in an environment characterized by east-northeast breezes, afternoon temperatures in the 80s F and dewpoints in the upper 60s-low 70s F. During the height of severe storm development, the mesoscale environment featured between 30-50 knots of deep-layer wind shear and mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg.",40.309,-100.17

758646,6/9/2018 5:31,56,MG,"A peak wind gust of 64 MPH was measured at Evelyn Sharp Field (Ord Airport), that occurred along a gust front ahead of an approaching line of thunderstorms from the northwest.","The very early morning hours on this Saturday featured a number of severe-criteria wind gusts across primarily the northeast half of South Central Nebraska, thanks to a squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) racing through from northwest-to-southeast. The strongest-known measured wind was 74 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island, shortly before 2 a.m. CDT. Other notable measured wind gusts included: 64 MPH at Ord airport, 62 MPH at both Hastings and York airports, and 59 MPH at Kearney airport. Ground-truth damage reports were fairly limited, but a cooperative observer near Shelby reported 7 diameter tree limbs down, and several overturned irrigation pivots in the area. In addition, a power line was downed by a fallen tree in Shelton, and power was also knocked out for a time in Red Cloud. This was almost purely a wind event, with storms producing little-to-no-hail, and the vast majority of severe gusts concentrating east-northeast of a line from western Buffalo County to Webster County.   Timing-wise, the leading edge of the squall line entered the far northern local area (Valley County) shortly after midnight CDT, with outflow winds surging several miles out ahead of the trailing precipitation core. Severe winds reached the Highway 30 corridor around 2 a.m. CDT, and a line from roughly Hastings-York by around 2:30 a.m. CDT. The last evidence of severe weather within the local area consisted of 60 MPH winds at a mesonet station near Nelson at 319 a.m. CDT. Well before reaching South Central Nebraska, the initial severe convection that eventually morphed into this fast-moving squall line developed over south central South Dakota during the late afternoon/early evening of the 8th. In the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly classic setup for nocturnal severe weather.

A relatively stationary boundary was situated across the western and southern portions of the state, acting as a focus for convective activity throughout the morning and early afternoon as convection lingered from the previous day. While there was not much opportunity to recover thermodynamically due to cloud cover, MUCAPE values remained in excess of 1000 J/kg in areas of convection and up to 2000 to 3000 J/kg in areas just to the west or south of the convection. Supporting parameters suggested the opportunity for a few organized storms with effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range and low level helicity in the 100 to 200 m2/s2 neighborhood. Another concern was the potential for training storms with the stationary boundary in place and expectations of low level jet aided initiation in the overnight hours.  In the end, a few severe storms were seen during the afternoon and evening hours, including hail approaching 2 inches in diameter, wind gusts to near 70 mph, and a vehicle heavily damaged from a lightning strike.

778032,9/1/2018 8:17,56,MG,A gust of 64 MPH was measured by the employees anemometer.,"A mesoscale convective system produced pockets of high winds and wind damage just after midnight on this Saturday morning. During the evening hours of Friday, scattered small clusters of multi-cell thunderstorms occurred over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The clusters over southwest Nebraska were moving to the east and the clusters over northwest Kansas were moving northeast. Between 10 and 11 PM CST, as these two areas of thunderstorms, and their outflows, began to merge, thunderstorm coverage began to increase as new thunderstorms formed between McCook and Lexington. The increase in coverage resulted in storm mergers and the formation of a larger multicell mesoscale convective system. Between 11 PM and 12 AM CST, the orientation of the MCS temporarily became northeast to southwest as new cells continued to develop along the Platte River. The MCS then morphed more into a circular shape as it moved northeast along Highway 30 from Grand Island to Columbus. Initially, some low-end severe hail occurred in parts of Furnas and Phelps counties, but as the MCS matured, severe winds became dominant. Powerful downburst winds occurred in portions of Kearney, Adams, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. The highest measured wind gust was 69 mph at a home weather station near the town of Norman. Other measured gusts included 58 mph at the Grand Island airport and 60 mph at the Hastings airport. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 57 mph occurred surrounding these areas and even far away from where the thunderstorms actually occurred. Winds were measured at 50 mph as far south as Red Cloud. Large tree limbs were snapped off in some spots around Grand Island and in Central City. Near the Platte River, just south of Central City, large tree limbs fell on a house and landed on top of vehicles.  These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from California to Maine and low in amplitude. There was no strong forcing aloft affecting the Central Plains. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, near 8.5 C/km. This resulted in very high instability with MUCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 30 kt.  This thunderstorm event was the first of several episodes of heavy rain which led to a very wet start of September for portions of south central Nebraska. Later in the evening on this Saturday, waves of thunderstorms formed over north central Kansas and repeatedly moved northeast into south central Nebraska with the greatest persistence south and east of Hastings. These waves of heavy rain continued through the night. There was a break from heavy rain during the day Sunday, but the next episode of heavy rain moved in Sunday evening. By daybreak on Monday, September 3rd, rainfall amounts totaled 3 to 5 inches across portions of northern Franklin, southern Adams, and southern Clay counties, as well as most of Fillmore, Webster, Nuckolls, and Thayer counties. This resulted in localized flash flooding with low spots in some county roads being washed out and Highway 4 being closed between Carleton and Davenport. As water drained into the headwaters of the Little Blue River, the river rapidly rose with minor flooding occurring. At Deweese, the river gauge peaked at 10.86 ft during the day Monday. Flood Stage is 10.0 ft.",40.77,-98.37

770428,6/30/2018 19:56,57,MG,nan,"Especially for counties south of Interstate 80 in South Central Nebraska, June finished with an active Saturday afternoon and evening of severe storms. Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan.   When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.  Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.  Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon. While the late-afternoon and evening storms were well-anticipated, if anything was a bit of a forecast surprise it was the early formation of the pair of intense supercells, which could have posed a more dire tornado threat had they tracked directly along the surface front instead of generally 10-20 miles north of it.",40.26,-99.9

778047,9/1/2018 23:35,57,MG,nan,"Severe thunderstorms produced very large hail and damaging winds across portions of Osborne, Jewell, and Mitchell counties late on this Saturday afternoon. Between 2 and 3 PM CST, the first couple storms began forming south and southwest of Hill City. Around 330 PM CST, one storm moved into southwestern Rooks county. It was joined by several other storms which continued to develop along I-70 between Wakeeney and Russell. As the Rooks county storm moved east, these storms moved north and they all merged over Osborne county. Just prior to the merger, a left-moving supercell, fresh after the split, produced hail up to the size of tennis balls near the southern border of Osborne county. After the merger, the newly-formed multicell cluster took the form of a small bow echo as it moved across Mitchell county between 5 and 6 PM CST. The mesoscale convective system produced strong downburst winds that were estimated at 60 mph over central Osborne county and measured at 66 mph over Mitchell county, just west of Beloit. While this was occurring, other cells formed over Jewell county and became severe. Before merging, the southern storm produced a measured wind gust of 78 mph in the town of Jewell, while the northern one produced spotty wind damage from the town of Mankato to Lovewell Reservoir. Tree limbs were snapped off in Mankato, at least one power pole was snapped off northeast of town, and an old county communications building suffered damage as the powerful downburst winds blew the roof off. Rain then damaged the radio equipment housed inside.  These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from Arizona to Maine and it was low in amplitude. A shortwave trough was along the New Mexico-Texas border and lifting northeast. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were near 90 with dewpoints in the middle to upper 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were near 7.0 C/km. This resulted in MLCAPE around 2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 40 kt.   This event was one of several episodes of heavy convective rains that contributed to a very wet start to September. This event alone produced 3 to 4 inch rain amounts over parts of Osborne and Mitchell counties as scattered non-severe storms continued to develop through the night, after the severe storms had exited north central Kansas.

778033,9/1/2018 6:33,60,MG,nan,"A mesoscale convective system produced pockets of high winds and wind damage just after midnight on this Saturday morning. During the evening hours of Friday, scattered small clusters of multi-cell thunderstorms occurred over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The clusters over southwest Nebraska were moving to the east and the clusters over northwest Kansas were moving northeast. Between 10 and 11 PM CST, as these two areas of thunderstorms, and their outflows, began to merge, thunderstorm coverage began to increase as new thunderstorms formed between McCook and Lexington. The increase in coverage resulted in storm mergers and the formation of a larger multicell mesoscale convective system. Between 11 PM and 12 AM CST, the orientation of the MCS temporarily became northeast to southwest as new cells continued to develop along the Platte River. The MCS then morphed more into a circular shape as it moved northeast along Highway 30 from Grand Island to Columbus. Initially, some low-end severe hail occurred in parts of Furnas and Phelps counties, but as the MCS matured, severe winds became dominant. Powerful downburst winds occurred in portions of Kearney, Adams, Hall, Hamilton, and Merrick counties. The highest measured wind gust was 69 mph at a home weather station near the town of Norman. Other measured gusts included 58 mph at the Grand Island airport and 60 mph at the Hastings airport. Widespread wind gusts between 50 and 57 mph occurred surrounding these areas and even far away from where the thunderstorms actually occurred. Winds were measured at 50 mph as far south as Red Cloud. Large tree limbs were snapped off in some spots around Grand Island and in Central City. Near the Platte River, just south of Central City, large tree limbs fell on a house and landed on top of vehicles.  These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front. The flow aloft was west-southwest from California to Maine and low in amplitude. There was no strong forcing aloft affecting the Central Plains. Before the thunderstorms moved in, temperatures were in the middle 70s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were very steep, near 8.5 C/km. This resulted in very high instability with MUCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 30 kt.  This thunderstorm event was the first of several episodes of heavy rain which led to a very wet start of September for portions of south central Nebraska. Later in the evening on this Saturday, waves of thunderstorms formed over north central Kansas and repeatedly moved northeast into south central Nebraska with the greatest persistence south and east of Hastings. These waves of heavy rain continued through the night. There was a break from heavy rain during the day Sunday, but the next episode of heavy rain moved in Sunday evening. By daybreak on Monday, September 3rd, rainfall amounts totaled 3 to 5 inches across portions of northern Franklin, southern Adams, and southern Clay counties, as well as most of Fillmore, Webster, Nuckolls, and Thayer counties. This resulted in localized flash flooding with low spots in some county roads being washed out and Highway 4 being closed between Carleton and Davenport. As water drained into the headwaters of the Little Blue River, the river rapidly rose with minor flooding occurring. At Deweese, the river gauge peaked at 10.86 ft during the day Monday.

During the evening and overnight hours a line of intense thunderstorms developed along a cold front that swept into western North Dakota, and tracked eastward across the state. Widespread wind damage occurred throughout much of western and central North Dakota, but the strongest winds centralized generally along and about 20 miles north and south of Highway 200, where episodes of microburst enhanced winds occurred. Within this corridor, many grain bins were lost, farm buildings and campers damaged or destroyed, and trees uprooted or snapped. The greatest wind damage occurred near Stanton, Mercer County, where a microburst with estimated 130 mph winds destroyed a farm.

752699,5/11/2018 6:02,61,MG,nan,"Severe thunderstorms produced widespread high winds between Interstate 80 and Highway 6 on this Thursday night and Friday morning. During the mid to late-afternoon hours Thursday, scattered thunderstorms developed from the Nebraska Panhandle down into northeast Colorado. Storm mergers, and an increasing number of storms, resulted in the formation of a squall line by 700 PM CST. This line of storms crossed most of south central Nebraska between 10 PM CST on the 10th and 1 AM CST on the 11th. These storms produced widespread measured gusts between 58 and 70 mph along the entire way across south central Nebraska from the Interstate 80 corridor south to Highway 6. A couple unofficial weather stations measured higher wind speeds including 80 mph near Axtell and 78 near Norman, both in Kearney County. Despite the coverage and magnitude of the winds, damage was only reported in a few spots. Tree branches were snapped off in Minden, an irrigation pivot was overturned near Glenvil, a few trees were blown down in Central City, and six utility poles were blown down or snapped off near Harvard. There were reports in southern Adams County and western Clay County of zero visibility in blowing dust as the high winds from the outflow moved in before the rain fell. Farmers had been preparing the fields for planting. So, top soil was loose and available for easy lofting and transport. Behind the squall line, other scattered thunderstorms developed. The strongest storms moved east along the entire length of Interstate 80 from Lexington to York between 1230 AM and 330 AM CST. These storms were mostly sub-severe, but there was a single report of one inch hail in Kearney at 2 AM CST.  During the morning hours of Thursday, a strong southward-moving cold front crossed Nebraska and became stationary along the northern Kansas border. A low pressure center formed over Wyoming and, by early evening, began moving east along the front. Meanwhile, chilly high pressure moved from the Canadian Prairies into the Great Lakes region. A broad upper-level ridge was over the Plains with a trough along the East Coast and another trough advancing through the western states. MUCAPE was around 1500 J/kg immediately preceding the storms. These storms formed on the northeast fringe of an elevated mixed layer that was advecting into the region, ahead of the western trough. Deep layer shear was 50 kts and greater. This environment was more than sufficient for severe thunderstorms. The cold pool associated with the squall line was strong.

Several roads had to be barricaded. There was some sandbagging at some farmsteads with several homes receiving water in their basements. The extreme rainfall also caused the dam at Lake Hiddenwood to burst sending water downstream resulting in more flash flooding. The entire lake was drained and water from the lake flowed for miles toward Sand Lake near the Walworth/Campbell county borders. The South Dakota governor requested a Presidential Disaster Declaration for Campbell, Walworth, and McPherson counties. The total estimated damage in all three counties was 3,115,000 dollars.

At noon CST, an area of scattered thunderstorms moved into north central Kansas. The area of storms was leftover from previous afternoon and nighttime convection and was associated with an advancing outflow boundary. By this time, new thunderstorms were beginning to form over north central Kansas as well. A quasi-stationary line of thunderstorms formed from southwest to northeast across Phillips and Rooks counties between noon and 4 PM CST. This line fell apart, but one last storm moved into Rooks County by 5 PM CST and weakened as it moved into southeastern Phillips County by 6 PM CST. Severe hail occurred in a couple spots around 1 PM CST. Hail the size of pennies fell just north of the town of Speed, and hail the size of quarters fell near the Phillips-Smith County line north of Agra. The final storm that weakened over Phillips County produced winds up to 70 mph near the town of Glade. The echo-training resulted in heavy rainfall amounts between 3 and 4 inches from western Rooks into central Phillips counties. Meanwhile, an area of 4-8 inches of rain fell over Gove, Graham, and Trego counties, with the highest observation of 9.88 inches measured in southwestern Graham County. As all this water drained into the South Fork of the Solomon River and Bow Creek, along with their tributaries, water levels shot up rapidly during the evening, with flooding occurring in crop and pasture land adjacent to these features. The South Fork of the Solomon River west of the Webster Reservoir rose into moderate flood stage and crested at 13.56 ft around 6 AM CST Tuesday (flood stage is 8.5 ft). Bow Creek near Stockton rose into minor flood stage and crested at 10.55 ft late Tuesday morning (flood stage is 9.0 ft). Just downstream from the river gauge, water from Bow Creek was flowing over the bridge near east 500 Rd and Day Dream Rd.   Scattered thunderstorms developed well to the west during the previous afternoon and night, along and ahead of a cold front. The resulting MCS sent an outflow boundary across north central Kansas, which aided in initiating new storms. A persistent trough was over the Western U.S. with an embedded cut-off low, with a downstream ridge over the Upper Midwest. Fairly weak southwest flow was over the Central Plains. In advance of the storms, temperatures had risen into the 80s with dewpoints in the 60s. Combined with mid-level lapse rates near 7.5 C/km, this resulted in MLCAPE between 2500 and 3000 J/kg.

There were several reports of large hail (up to baseball size), damaging winds (up to around 70 MPH), a few pockets of very heavy rainfall into mainly the 3-5 range, and one brief EF-0 tornado. This tornado, which exhibited multi-vortex structure along its short path, was caught on video by a storm chaser near Huntley in eastern Harlan County around 5:45 p.m. CDT. Shortly before dropping the tornado, this high-precipitation (HP) supercell storm also yielded tennis ball to baseball size hail several miles north of Orleans. Other notable hail reports on this day included 2 diameter stones near Franklin and ping pong ball size near Blue Hill. As for damaging winds, the highest measured gusts (unofficial sources) featured 71 MPH near Carleton and 63 MPH near Holbrook. At least minor tree/branch damage was reported in or near Cambridge and Naponee, and power lines were blown down near Republican City. Rainfall-wise, the majority of the 24-county area received at least 1 of mostly-welcomed rainfall. However, there were generally four distinct zones that got drenched with noticeably higher amounts of at least 3-4, and locally more. These included portions of the following counties: much of southern/eastern Thayer; much of northern Furnas and adjacent portions of Gosper/Phelps/Harlan; parts of northern Nuckolls/southern Clay; and parts of northeastern York. A few of the highest official 24-hour totals (NWS coop and CoCoRaHS observers) featured: 5.14 northeast of Chester, 4.52 near Deweese, 3.86 in Edison and 3.80 in Hubbell. There was also an unofficial report of a whopping 7 south of Gilead in far southeast Thayer County. Although there were surely several instances of fairly minor flooding and even brief flash flooding, ground truth reports were rather limited.   Breaking down event evolution/timing, the first strong to severe storms of the afternoon fired up between 3:30-5:00 p.m. CDT on opposite ends of the local area, with one cluster in Thayer County and the other centered over Furnas County. During the next couple hours, intense multicell convection gradually connected the gap between the original two clusters, eventually resulting in one semi-organized band. However, during this same time, the most intense storm of the day took center stage as an embedded HP supercell tracked across much of Harlan and southern Franklin counties, producing very large hail and the aforementioned brief tornado. Between 7 p.m. CDT and nightfall, convection expanded in areal coverage to encompass most all of South Central Nebraska, while the overall severe weather threat diminished. However, around 9 p.m. CDT another cluster of vigorous convection rolled in from the west, yielding a few reports of marginally-severe winds in Furnas County. These were the last severe reports of the evening, with only a large shield of mainly light to moderate rain persisting well past midnight, while gradually ending from west-to-east.   Closing with some meteorological background, this was a well-anticipated round of severe storms and heavy rainfall, as low-amplitude shortwave energy tracked into Nebraska around the southeast periphery of a larger-scale trough/closed low centered over the Northern Rockies.

During the mid to late-afternoon hours Thursday, scattered thunderstorms developed from the Nebraska Panhandle down into northeast Colorado. Storm mergers, and an increasing number of storms, resulted in the formation of a squall line by 700 PM CST. This line of storms crossed most of south central Nebraska between 10 PM CST on the 10th and 1 AM CST on the 11th. These storms produced widespread measured gusts between 58 and 70 mph along the entire way across south central Nebraska from the Interstate 80 corridor south to Highway 6. A couple unofficial weather stations measured higher wind speeds including 80 mph near Axtell and 78 near Norman, both in Kearney County. Despite the coverage and magnitude of the winds, damage was only reported in a few spots. Tree branches were snapped off in Minden, an irrigation pivot was overturned near Glenvil, a few trees were blown down in Central City, and six utility poles were blown down or snapped off near Harvard.

A nearby mesonet recorded a gust of 66 MPH at 1:59 AM CDT.","The very early morning hours on this Saturday featured a number of severe-criteria wind gusts across primarily the northeast half of South Central Nebraska, thanks to a squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) racing through from northwest-to-southeast. The strongest-known measured wind was 74 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island, shortly before 2 a.m. CDT. Other notable measured wind gusts included: 64 MPH at Ord airport, 62 MPH at both Hastings and York airports, and 59 MPH at Kearney airport.

In addition, a power line was downed by a fallen tree in Shelton, and power was also knocked out for a time in Red Cloud. This was almost purely a wind event, with storms producing little-to-no-hail, and the vast majority of severe gusts concentrating east-northeast of a line from western Buffalo County to Webster County.   Timing-wise, the leading edge of the squall line entered the far northern local area (Valley County) shortly after midnight CDT, with outflow winds surging several miles out ahead of the trailing precipitation core. Severe winds reached the Highway 30 corridor around 2 a.m. CDT, and a line from roughly Hastings-York by around 2:30 a.m. CDT. The last evidence of severe weather within the local area consisted of 60 MPH winds at a mesonet station near Nelson at 319 a.m. CDT. Well before reaching South Central Nebraska, the initial severe convection that eventually morphed into this fast-moving squall line developed over south central South Dakota during the late afternoon/early evening of the 8th. In the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly classic setup for nocturnal severe weather. While forcing was not overly-strong, a low-amplitude disturbance tracked across mainly northern NE/southern SD through the night, embedded within a broad, quasi-zonal flow regime. Once the afternoon/early evening storms over southern SD grew upscale into an organized MCS, southeastward propagation into the local area was fostered by a southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) strengthening to 30-40 knots. Around the time convection surged into northern local counties, mesoscale parameters featured around 1000-2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, and moderate deep-layer (0-6 km) shear of 30-40 knots.",40.97,-98.32

This line of storms crossed most of south central Nebraska between 10 PM CST on the 10th and 1 AM CST on the 11th. These storms produced widespread measured gusts between 58 and 70 mph along the entire way across south central Nebraska from the Interstate 80 corridor south to Highway 6. A couple unofficial weather stations measured higher wind speeds including 80 mph near Axtell and 78 near Norman, both in Kearney County. Despite the coverage and magnitude of the winds, damage was only reported in a few spots. Tree branches were snapped off in Minden, an irrigation pivot was overturned near Glenvil, a few trees were blown down in Central City, and six utility poles were blown down or snapped off near Harvard. There were reports in southern Adams County and western Clay County of zero visibility in blowing dust as the high winds from the outflow moved in before the rain fell.

It was joined by several other storms which continued to develop along I-70 between Wakeeney and Russell. As the Rooks county storm moved east, these storms moved north and they all merged over Osborne county. Just prior to the merger, a left-moving supercell, fresh after the split, produced hail up to the size of tennis balls near the southern border of Osborne county. After the merger, the newly-formed multicell cluster took the form of a small bow echo as it moved across Mitchell county between 5 and 6 PM CST. The mesoscale convective system produced strong downburst winds that were estimated at 60 mph over central Osborne county and measured at 66 mph over Mitchell county, just west of Beloit. While this was occurring, other cells formed over Jewell county and became severe. Before merging, the southern storm produced a measured wind gust of 78 mph in the town of Jewell, while the northern one produced spotty wind damage from the town of Mankato to Lovewell Reservoir. Tree limbs were snapped off in Mankato, at least one power pole was snapped off northeast of town, and an old county communications building suffered damage as the powerful downburst winds blew the roof off. Rain then damaged the radio equipment housed inside.  These storms formed along and ahead of a Canadian cold front.

770430,6/30/2018 21:27,70,MG,Wind gust was measured on a portable anemometer.,"Especially for counties south of Interstate 80 in South Central Nebraska, June finished with an active Saturday afternoon and evening of severe storms. Things started off with two discrete supercells featuring intense, crop-damaging hail and a few brief tornadoes, followed a few hours later by a larger-scale squall line/linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that yielded sporadic damaging winds and torrential rainfall. The two confirmed EF-0 tornadoes were spawned by the eastern supercell in southeastern Phelps County around 4 p.m. CDT and inflicted no evident damage. As for large hail, both supercells produced at least golf ball size stones, including reports from the Arapahoe, Loomis and Axtell and Minden areas. However, the western storm also featured a report of baseball size hail three miles southeast of Loomis (see below for more details regarding resultant crop damage). Turning to damaging winds, the aforementioned pair of supercells yielded a handful of measured and estimated reports, including 80 MPH near Axtell (measured by a storm spotter). A bit later and farther east, an evolving cluster of multicell storms with estimated 80 MPH winds brought isolated wind damage to a few rural residences in far eastern Clay County, including: destroyed carports and hog sheds, and a partially-removed garage roof. Later in the evening, the more expansive MCS that swept across all of South Central Nebraska from west-to-east yielded mostly sub-severe gusts of 45-55 MPH. However, a handful of severe-criteria gusts of at least 60-65 MPH occurred in both far western areas (near Cambridge) and also far eastern areas (Fillmore/Thayer counties). In the eastern area, a camper blew over near Hebron and a large tree fell on a home in Milligan.   When all was said and done, the overall-biggest severe weather impact from the day was likely the localized-but-extensive crop damage caused by the initial pair of supercells in the southwestern quadrant of South Central Nebraska. The western supercell, which tracked from north central Furnas County to central Phelps County mainly between 2:30-4:30 p.m. CDT was particularly impactful, as satellite imagery in the following days revealed a roughly 2-3 mile wide by 15+ mile long swath of near-complete crop destruction. While not the main story, locally heavy rainfall and mainly minor/short-term flooding also occurred, with large portions of several counties receiving at least 1.50, much of which fell in a short time. The overall-heaviest rain into the 3-4range concentrated in two main zones: 1) parts of northern Furnas/southeastern Gosper and western Phelps counties, including 3.21 at Loomis...2) much of York, eastern Hamilton and southern Polk counties, including 4.09 near York and 3.26 near Stromsburg. In all three Tri Cities, the evening squall line produced brief-but-intense rainfall that prompted short-term street flooding, with reports of stalled vehicles in Kearney and the closure of the Burlington Avenue underpass in downtown Hastings.  Taking a closer look at the timing and evolution of convection, things got underway between 2-3 p.m. CDT as severe storms rapidly fired up over northern Furnas and Harlan counties. During the following few hours, these storms organized into the aforementioned pair of noteworthy classic supercells, with the western one eventually dissipating over Phelps County, while the eastern one marched across Kearney County and into western Adams County before weakening and merging into newly-developing multicell storms to its south and east. Between 5:30-7:30 p.m. CDT the main focus turned to a cluster of strong-to-severe multicells that expanded across eastern portions of the area, yielding mainly heavy rain and small hail, but also the eastern Clay County wind damage. As these storms exited stage right into eastern Nebraska, nearly all of South Central Nebraska had roughly an hour of storm-free conditions before attention turned back to the west as the leading edge of the north-south oriented squall line entered Dawson/Gosper/Furnas counties between 8:30-9:30 p.m. CDT. Over the next 2-3 hours, this mostly (but not entirely) sub-severe MCS swept through the remainder of the area, with the leading edge of strongest winds/heaviest rain exiting into eastern Nebraska shortly after midnight CDT.  Finishing with a look at the meteorological background and starting with the mid-upper levels, this was a fairly evident severe weather setup as a semi-potent shortwave trough (by early-summer standards) tracked from Wyoming into western Nebraska during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, a well-defined, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented frontal boundary stretched from northwest Kansas to southeast Nebraska throughout the day, with most of the local area residing just to its north in an environment characterized by easterly breezes, high temperatures in the 80s F and plentiful low-level moisture with dewpoints between the mid-60s and low-70s F. Deep-layer wind shear averaged around 40 knots throughout the event, with mixed-layer CAPE peaking 2000-3000 J/kg during the afternoon. While the late-afternoon and evening storms were well-anticipated, if anything was a bit of a forecast surprise it was the early formation of the pair of intense supercells, which could have posed a more dire tornado threat had they tracked directly along the surface front instead of generally 10-20 miles north of it.",40.47,-99.16

MUCAPE values were in excess of 5000 J/kg throughout much of central Nebraska, along with DCAPE in excess of 1200-1500 J/kg, effective shear around 30 to 40 kts, roughly perpendicularly oriented 0-3 km shear vectors to the storm orientation, and supporting composite parameters such as MCS Maintenance and Derecho Composite that pointed towards a potentially long-lived convective complex.   The environment (thermodynamic, moisture, and wind profiles) roughly remained the same as the complex moved eastward, before taking on a more southeast and eventually southern motion, following a strong CAPE gradient.  What transpired in Iowa was an eastward moving complex that took on a more linear orientation throughout the morning and quickly trekked across the southern third of the state through the morning and early afternoon. In its wake was dozens of reports of whole trees down, power lines and poles down, other damage reports, and measured wind gusts in excess of 65-70 mph.",41.37,-93.57

Damage included blown down power poles, building damage, uprooted trees, overturned pivots, windows blown out of a home and vehicles.","Between the evening of Wednesday the 6th and sunrise on Thursday the 7th, the majority of the 24-county South Central Nebraska area saw at least some thunderstorm activity. For most places though, storms were fairly weak, producing only rainfall and modest wind gusts. However, there were two glaring and rather localized exceptions featuring ground-truth of severe wind gusts, one in the far northeast portion of the local area and the other in the southwest. More specifically, around 815 p.m. CDT on the 6th, a southward-surging outflow boundary with estimated wind gusts to 70 MPH destroyed a metal outbuilding a few miles northeast of Osceola (northwest of Shelby). Then several hours later, shortly after 3 a.m. CDT on the 7th, a surge of very intense winds along a bowing line segment (measured at 91 MPH on a personal weather station) caused considerable damage in a small portion of western Harlan County between Orleans and Oxford, including: uprooted trees, overturned pivots and windows blown out of a home.  Breaking down the evolution of thunderstorms over the course of this time frame, things first initiated in far northeast portions of the local area during the mid-afternoon and late-evening hours. As early as around 4 p.m. CDT, an isolated storm produced nickel size hail near Fullerton. While this early activity faded quickly, a few hours later a cluster of severe storms developed slightly north of Polk/Nance counties, with the resultant southward-surging outflow causing the Polk County damage before sunset. Interestingly, this damage occurred at least 5-10 miles south of the leading edge of any rainfall. During the next few hours, until around 11 p.m. CDT, a northwest-southeast oriented line of strong storms continued affecting mainly Nance and northern Greeley counties, but there were no additional severe-criteria reports. As the pre-midnight activity was occurring in the northeast, a separate cluster of strong to severe storms developed well off to the west in the Nebraska-Colorado-Kansas border region, eventually tracking into far southwestern portions of the local area between midnight-1 a.m. CDT in the form of a linear mesoscale convective system (MCS). Although the majority of severe-criteria wind gusts associated with this complex focused just to the south within northwest/north central Kansas, a northward-surging bow in the convective line developed rather abruptly over southwestern Harlan County around 2:30 a.m. CDT. This small-scale feature soon caused the aforementioned, extensive-but-localized damage in west-central Harlan County. Winds diminished in intensity as they swept north into Phelps County, but a mesonet station north-northwest of Holdrege still managed a 58 MPH gust at 3:41 a.m. CDT. This was the last severe weather report of the day, as convection steadily weakened and diminished in coverage through the mid-morning hours.  In the mid-upper levels, these events of the 6th-7th occurred in a subtly-forced environment, as Nebraska resided under weak westerly flow along the northern periphery of a ridge extending up from the Southern Plains. As a result, deep-layer wind shear was weak, only averaging around 25 knots or less. However, there was plentiful instability, as the combination of afternoon temperatures in the 90s F and dewpoints well into the 60s F yielded mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon/early-evening. At the surface, this activity occurred to the south of a west-east oriented, quasi-stationary front draped through northern Nebraska.",40.1914,-99.5304

The most severe weather occurred across southeast Montana, mainly Carter County where golf ball size and larger hail, straight line winds 70-80 mph and four tornadoes were reported.   Around 7:17 PM, the first tornado was spotted crossing SR 323 in Carter County about 12 miles north of Albion in the Finger Butte Area. This tornado was spotted by a rancher about a mile to the south. His property sustained straight line wind damage on the south side of the storm, including trees uprooted, a barn roof blown off, a shed destroyed, and a horse trailer flipped over. This wind damage was consistent with 70-80 mph winds. This tornado left no trace along SR 323 and moved through open terrain before lifting. This tornado has been assigned a rating of EF-0 since no damage markers could be observed.

The most severe weather occurred across southeast Montana, mainly Carter County where golf ball size and larger hail, straight line winds 70-80 mph and four tornadoes were reported.   Around 7:17 PM, the first tornado was spotted crossing SR 323 in Carter County about 12 miles north of Albion in the Finger Butte Area. This tornado was spotted by a rancher about a mile to the south. His property sustained straight line wind damage on the south side of the storm, including trees uprooted, a barn roof blown off, a shed destroyed, and a horse trailer flipped over. This wind damage was consistent with 70-80 mph winds. This tornado left no trace along SR 323 and moved through open terrain before lifting. This tornado has been assigned a rating of EF-0 since no damage markers could be observed. Storm chasers following this storm as it pushed east through rural areas of Carter County noticed two additional brief tornado touchdowns. These tornadoes were in extremely rural and open areas with no road access to do damage surveys.   At approximately 8:06 PM, another tornado touched down just east of Camp Crook Road 4 miles south of Capitol, MT. In its initial phases, this tornado skipped along the ground, as confirmed by chaser video, producing sporadic snapped trees and downed limbs consistent with winds 80-90 mph (EF-0 to EF-1).   Damage survey and eye witness accounts confirm the tornado initially moved north-north-east along the Little Missouri River. As it approached the river it intensified to 120 mph (EF-2) producing an increasingly wider swath of snapped trees several hundred yards wide. The tornado started to turn more to the east at this time, moving on a northeasterly track as it crossed the Little Missouri and moved across the Montana/South Dakota border.  The tornadoes stayed mostly over rural areas producing limited damage. The damage that has been surveyed has ranged from EF-0 to EF-3. The most significant damage appears to have occurred with a tornado that touched down south of Capitol, Montana and moved into South Dakota. Damaged observed just across the border in South Dakota is consistent with an EF-3 tornado rating, with winds estimated at 136 mph.

Around 7:17 PM, the first tornado was spotted crossing SR 323 in Carter County about 12 miles north of Albion in the Finger Butte Area. This tornado was spotted by a rancher about a mile to the south. His property sustained straight line wind damage on the south side of the storm, including trees uprooted, a barn roof blown off, a shed destroyed, and a horse trailer flipped over. This wind damage was consistent with 70-80 mph winds. This tornado left no trace along SR 323 and moved through open terrain before lifting. This tornado has been assigned a rating of EF-0 since no damage markers could be observed. Storm chasers following this storm as it pushed east through rural areas of Carter County noticed two additional brief tornado touchdowns. These tornadoes were in extremely rural and open areas with no road access to do damage surveys.   At approximately 8:06 PM, another tornado touched down just east of Camp Crook Road 4 miles south of Capitol, MT. In its initial phases, this tornado skipped along the ground, as confirmed by chaser video, producing sporadic snapped trees and downed limbs consistent with winds 80-90 mph (EF-0 to EF-1).   Damage survey and eye witness accounts confirm the tornado initially moved north-north-east along the Little Missouri River. As it approached the river it intensified to 120 mph (EF-2) producing an increasingly wider swath of snapped trees several hundred yards wide. The tornado started to turn more to the east at this time, moving on a northeasterly track as it crossed the Little Missouri and moved across the Montana/South Dakota border.  The tornadoes stayed mostly over rural areas producing limited damage. The damage that has been surveyed has ranged from EF-0 to EF-3. The most significant damage appears to have occurred with a tornado that touched down south of Capitol, Montana and moved into South Dakota.

A barn roof and shed were lost and a horse trailer tipped over.,"During the late afternoon and evening hours on June 28th, severe weather broke out across much of the Billings Forecast Area. The most severe weather occurred across southeast Montana, mainly Carter County where golf ball size and larger hail, straight line winds 70-80 mph and four tornadoes were reported.   Around 7:17 PM, the first tornado was spotted crossing SR 323 in Carter County about 12 miles north of Albion in the Finger Butte Area. This tornado was spotted by a rancher about a mile to the south. His property sustained straight line wind damage on the south side of the storm, including trees uprooted, a barn roof blown off, a shed destroyed, and a horse trailer flipped over. This wind damage was consistent with 70-80 mph winds. This tornado left no trace along SR 323 and moved through open terrain before lifting. This tornado has been assigned a rating of EF-0 since no damage markers could be observed. Storm chasers following this storm as it pushed east through rural areas of Carter County noticed two additional brief tornado touchdowns. These tornadoes were in extremely rural and open areas with no road access to do damage surveys.   At approximately 8:06 PM, another tornado touched down just east of Camp Crook Road 4 miles south of Capitol, MT. In its initial phases, this tornado skipped along the ground, as confirmed by chaser video, producing sporadic snapped trees and downed limbs consistent with winds 80-90 mph (EF-0 to EF-1).   Damage survey and eye witness accounts confirm the tornado initially moved north-north-east along the Little Missouri River. As it approached the river it intensified to 120 mph (EF-2) producing an increasingly wider swath of snapped trees several hundred yards wide. The tornado started to turn more to the east at this time, moving on a northeasterly track as it crossed the Little Missouri and moved across the Montana/South Dakota border.  The tornadoes stayed mostly over rural areas producing limited damage. The damage that has been surveyed has ranged from EF-0 to EF-3. The most significant damage appears to have occurred with a tornado that touched down south of Capitol, Montana and moved into South Dakota. Damaged observed just across the border in South Dakota is consistent with an EF-3 tornado rating, with winds estimated at 136 mph. Damage observed includes one home destroyed, heavy hay bales moved, along with the debarking of some trees.",45.31,-104.45
