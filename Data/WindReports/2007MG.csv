By evening, low pressure lifted north along a cold front to the west of the state.  The cold front advanced into the state during the evening.  Convection was limited during the afternoon due to a mid level cap and considerable low level cloudiness.  Still, the atmosphere became quite unstable by the evening hours.  Surface temperatures rose to the mid 60s to mid 70s across the CWA with dew points rising into the upper 50s to low 60s.  Effective shear was in the 30 to 45 kt range with most unstable CAPE values in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  Lifted indices fell to the -3 to -6 C. range by evening.  As was the case during the morning, freezing levels were in the 11,000 to 12,000 foot range.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer was around 200 J/kg.  Thunderstorms developed just ahead of the cold front on the west edge of the mid level cap before sunset.  The storms took on a linear configuration as the moved into the state.  There were two stronger areas along the line.  The first was across the northern part of the state, the second along the southern two tiers of counties.  Most of the storms produced hail with most reports around an inch in diameter or less.  The southern part of the line took on more of a bow echo appearance and began to produce high winds.  Wind gusts to near 60 MPH in Bedford in Taylor County, and in the 50 to 60 MPH range northwest of Lamoni in Decatur County.  One tornado touched down in Wayne County.  The tornado had an intermittent track, touching down southwest of the town of Sewal and dissipating about a mile northeast of town.  Damage was done to buildings on the south side of the town.

Surface low pressure tracked very close to the upper low, moving from central Kansas into north central Iowa.  Conditions were marginal with the most unstable CAPE around 500 J/kg, even though the Lifted Index was in the -4 to -5 C. range just prior to the storm development.  The zero to 6 km shear was 50 to 60 kts, with zero to 1 km shear in the 20 to 30 kt range.  The effective shear was in the 40 to 55 kt range.  Thunderstorms moved across the state in two lines.  The first moved through around mid day, followed by the dry slot.  The second line formed very close to the core of the upper low and lifted northeast across the CWA during the mid to late afternoon hours.  In spite of the freezing level being only 9400 feet, and with 100 J/kg of CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere, there was little in the way of hail with the storms.  The lack of discrete cell development meant the storms were not able to capitalize on the relatively low LCL level of 500 to 1250 meters across the CWA.  The storms produced gusty winds as they passed with a 50 kt wind reported early on as the storms moved through the Atlantic area of Cass County.",41.41,-95.06

Freezing levels were between 14,500 and 15,000 feet.  The LCL was a relatively low 750 to 1000 meters, however downdraft CAPE was very high, between 1200 and 1600 J/kg.  Winds dominated the event as the storms advanced rapidly eastward in a shear environment of 40 to 50 kts.  There were numerous reports of trees toppled and power line damage.  Wind gusts of 60 to 70 MPH were common.  Some of the higher gusts came from the Adair area.  Mesonet sites reported wind gusts of 66 to 71 MPH in the area.",41.03,-94.2
58881,8/19/2007 8:10,50,MG,nan,"Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic Hurricane season, developed quickly over the northeast Gulf of Mexico on the 15th, before moving onshore during the morning hours of the 16th. Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches. Rivers and creeks easily exceeded their banks, with water also rising quickly in many towns. Dozens of people were rescued by boat and helicopter as numerous homes and businesses quickly took on water. Unfortunately, six people lost their lives due to the flooding. Monetary values were estimated.",35.32,-97.93
41784,8/21/2007 2:19,50,MG,High winds were measured by a KCCI Schoolnet site.,"Little change took place in the overall weather pattern with a nearly stationary frontal boundary remaining over the state.  The morning convection moved off allowing for afternoon solar isolation to take place, destabilizing the atmosphere once again.  Temperatures over the southwest half of the state warmed into the mid to upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  West of Iowa it warmed into the mid 90s with mid 70 dew points.  The airmass became very unstable with CAPE in the the 5000 to 8000 J/kg range from western Iowa west.  Lifted indices fell into the -10 to -14 C. range by late afternoon.  A considerable amount of shear remained in place with 40 to 55 kts present at the time of thunderstorm development.  The LCL was reasonably high however at 1000 to 1500 meters.  Thunderstorms developed in to a linear complex that showed a few bow echo elements along the leading edge.  The main weather features with this system were high winds and hail.  The available downdraft CAPE was between 1200 and 1500 J/kg and was favorable for high winds.  There was 600 to 900 J/kg of available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere.  In spite of the high values, hail size was limited by the high freezing levels, between 14,500 feet to over 15,500 feet.  As the storms moved into the western part of the CWA, winds were the strongest.  Reports of winds between 60  and 70 MPH were common along the leading edge of the line.  The winds diminished as the storms moved east.  Hail reports were spotty with this event.  The hail was relatively small with most of it in the three quarter to one inch diameter range.  The storms produced heavy rainfall once again with 1.6 to 1.8 inches of precipitable water available.  The heavy rain fell in areas that were affected by the past several days of rain.  Calhoun and Webster had some flash flooding, but it was relatively minor and limited to road closures caused by water flowing over the roads.",40.99,-94.74

There was a strong contrast across the front with highs in the low 90s south of the front with dew points in the low to mid 70s, and temperatures in the 60s and 70s north of the front.  The airmass was quite unstable with CAPE between 3000 and 4000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -6 to -8 C. range.  There was sufficient shear in place and was in the 35 to 50 kt range.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was 500 to 700 J/kg, however with freezing levels 15,000 to 15,500 feet hail was not realized in severe size at the ground level.  The LCL was between 1000 and 1500 meters along the lead edge of the thunderstorms.  As the front progressed southeast, a line of thunderstorms developed just ahead of the front.  They developed quite rapidly as the cap was broken.  The air was fairly dry in the lower levels leading to downdraft CAPE of 1000 to 1500 J/kg.    In spite of the dry layer at low levels, precipitable water values were quite high, in the 1.5 to 1.7 inch range.  Many of the storms remained below severe levels.  An upper level vorticity max lifted northeast across eastern Nebraska into western Iowa during the late afternoon and evening hours.  This intensified storms over eastern Nebraska, which moved into western Iowa.  The storms became severe and produced high winds and several tornadoes from west central into central Iowa.  The line took on a very evident bow echo as it moved through Crawford County, and that remained in tact as far east as Story County.  Numerous reports of tree damage and power line damage were received, with winds of 60 to 70 MPH common.  Winds were strong enough to partially blow over a utility pole near Jamaica in Guthrie County.  A semitrailer truck was blown off off of County Road E-57 west of Kelly in Story County.  Tornadoes touched down in Carroll and Greene Counties.  They were short lived and were only on the ground for a short time in rural areas.  One of them touched down in Carroll County north of Dedham, while a short time later a second touched down north of Coon Rapids downing utility poles.  An aerial survey showed a very intermittent track, beginning about 3 miles north of Coon Rapids in Carroll County, continuing east for approximately 15 miles.  It dissipated in Greene County just west of Cooper.  Maximum path width was 50 yards.  Crop damage and power poles were bent but no structures were significantly impacted.  There was a two mile continuous swath of corn damage occurring about four miles west of Cooper with numerous meanders and turns.  EF0 damage ended at approximately 1825 PM CST.  Another tornado was on the ground for about 5 minutes in an intermittent track from southwest to south of Rippey.  Minor roof damage was done and some windows were blown out by the tornado southwest of Rippey.  Another tornado touched down in Guthrie County west of Bayard.  An aerial survey showed a 3/4 mile long track that was embedded in the west to east outflow of the storm.  A 50 yard wide track of damaged corn and a dozen trees downed at a farmstead were observed.  A few shingles were blown off the house, but otherwise no other significant building damage was noted.  The tornado was and EF0.  Flash flooding was also a concern with flash flooding taking place in Calhoun and Wright Counties.  Water was flowing over roads and into some basements.

A roof was also blown off a building and onto powerlines.,"A strong squall line associated with a frontal boundary and weak upper level disturbance moved into the forecast area causing widespread severe weather and isolated flooding. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.  As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Bealls Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people.   As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area.  A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.  The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.  Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a “widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.”   While straight-line winds are common across West Texas – especially during the late spring and early summer – the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.  During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland’s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.

Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast.

Precipitable water values were in the 1.5 to 1.75 inch range.  Thunderstorms formed in two areas.  An area of thunderstorms formed over north west into north central Iowa.  These were ahead of a line of intense thunderstorms that moved in from Nebraska during the early evening.  Initially, the storms produced high winds.  Winds of 70 to 80 MPH hit Pocahontas County in the Rolfe and Plover areas.  Outbuildings and grain bins were blown over in Humboldt  County in the Bradgate area, and a downburst occurred in the Worth County at Manley.  Downburst winds also hit south of Bode in Humboldt County.  High winds snapped off 40 utility poles in the area.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines down in northwest and north central Iowa.  Late in the event, a small bow segment dropped southeast across Marshall County and produced a 59 MPH wind gust at the RWIS site there.  The main event was the heavy rainfall and flash flooding.  Soil conditions were extremely wet with many of the areas across northern Iowa receiving 6 to 12 inches of rain during the past week.  The additional rain on the evening of the 21st caused considerable flash flooding.  In Humboldt, for example, 5.7 inches of rain fell with the passage of the line.

Low pressure developed over eastern Colorado and advanced across Kansas into Iowa.  A warm front extended east from the low and lifted northward into southern Iowa during the overnight hours.  Very strong theta-e advection took place during the evening north of the warm front as the low level jet increased to between 50 and 60 kts. Though surface based CAPE was limited, elevated CAPE from around 750 mb was near 2500 J/kg with a lifted index from that level of -8 C.  With the relatively dry air in the lower levels, the tornado threat was limited with the LCL in the 1500 plus meter range.  There was considerable shear available with effective shear values in the 50 to 60 kt range.  With much of the CAPE elevated in nature, there was a fair amount of CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere with a little over 200 J/kg available.  Thunderstorms erupted first during the mid evening hours to the north of the warm front as moisture moved into the area.  They developed very rapidly.  At the same time, an intense bow echo developed over western Nebraska and raced east.  During the late evening hours, the storms north of the warm front became very numerous and diminished in intensity.  As the bow echo approached from Nebraska, the enhanced low level jet ahead of it fired up another round of severe thunderstorms along and north of the warm front.  The thunderstorms that formed north of the warm front were prolific hail producers.  There were numerous reports of hail covering the ground with these storms in both the mid evening and early morning rounds of storms.  Much of the hail was one half inch or less in diameter however.  Nearly all of the storms produced at least some hail and many did pulse to severe levels occasionally.  Hail reports were quite numerous with hail size in the three quarter to 1 inch diameter range.  One storm produced golf ball size hail in Black Hawk County near Hudson.  As the bow echo moved into western Iowa from Nebraska, wind became the more significant threat.  The system weakened as it moved into Iowa, but did produce a widespread area of winds of 40 to 50 MPH.  Spotty damage occurred with the bow echo with a wind gust of 61 MPH in Adair County at Adair.

An outflow boundary from the previous nights convection pushed south across the CWA, reaching the southern part by sunrise.  This boundary combined with a quasi-stationary frontal boundary that was across the southern counties.  The atmosphere became unstable quite rapidly during the late morning and early afternoon.  Surface low pressure was located over southwest Iowa, with a warm front extending east  South of the warm front temperatures warmed to around 90 F. with dew points in the upper 60s to low 70s.  Surface based CAPE rose to 3000 to 4000 J/kg with the lifted index falling into the -8 to -10 C. range.  The cap broke by around 1800 UTC as an MCS began to develop over central Iowa.  The environment was fairly favorable with 30 to 40 kts of effective shear and precipitable water values around 1.5 inches.  Available cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  DCAPE values were between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Two tornadoes touched down in Warren County.  First indication of ground contact from the first tornado was adjacent to I-35 0.60 miles north of the Cumming, IA/G-14 interchange and approximately 1 mile NW of the town of Cumming.  Ground contact evident to the southeast along a path of approximately 125 degrees. First structural damage (EF1) noted at a farm house at G14 and 20th Ave.  Path width at this point estimated at 100 yards.  Continuous ground contact southeast to farmstead at G14 and 25th Ave where north facing garage was destroyed (EF1) and outbuildings and trailer damaged.  The tornado continued SE and reached widest point of approximately 200 yards striking outbuildings. Debris swath is noted to NE and also SE indicating the possibility of multi vortex circulation.  A farmstead at 30th Ave and Clark street sustained EF1 damage to grain bin and outbuildings. Path width approximately 150 yards. Corn from grain bin was noted well downstream at end of track, some corn impacted side of Phillips home in SE Norwalk.  Continuous ground contact ended and path narrowed considerably just north of Clarke St. near the Happy Apple Orchard. This resulted in a continuous tornado path of 2.2 miles.  Intermittent damage path continued SE for 1.5 miles across fields and wooded areas with path of 30 to 50 yards. Next structural damage occurred to a light garage (EF0).  The track turned E/NE Approximately  080 degrees for .6 mile, with intermittent damage consisting of snapped and mangled trees. Path width 30 to 50 yards. Mature  2 diameter trees along farm pond snapped at trunk and tops of trees deposited to the NE. The track turns SE for .75 mile before again turning E/NE.  Narrow swath of tree damage noted.  The track continues ENE (approximately 070 degrees) across Highway 28 where EF0 damage was noted. Ground scouring/swirl marks noted along 1.9 mile track ending at the Phillips home on the SE corner of Norwalk where EF2 damage was observed. Tornado appeared to quickly dissipate on the NE of the home. Maximum path width 200 yards along the over 7 mile long track.  The second tornado was first verified over the Legacy Golf Course, just NW of the Norwalk Fire Station.  It is interesting to note the tornado passed directly over the fire station, producing a circular pattern in the gravel on the roof, and blowing out two overhead doors.  The tornado was narrow, with most damage consisting of tree damage up to EF1 and light structural damage as it moved to the SE.   The path width ranges from 10 yards to a maximum of approximately 100-150 yards.

A farmstead on R57 south of Coolidge St. sustained tree damage from tornado #2.  This is just south of the Phillips home that was damaged by the first tornado.  Winds were estimated at 125 MPH in the first tornado, and 100 MPH in the second.   Fortunately, there were no injuries during the tornado occurrences themselves, however one person was injured during recovery.  LCL levels were lower than the previous day, in the 750 to 1000 meter range.  As the complex evolved, the primary modes of severe weather were hail and high wind.  The freezing level was lower than the previous day, at 13,900 feet and many of the storms contained at least some hail.  The hail was not overly large, with most reports in the three quarter to one inch range.  During the storms evolution, there were several bow echo segments, resulting in high winds.  Winds of 80 MPH occurred southwest of Norwalk, in the rear flank downdraft of the supercell over the county in association with the tornadoes.  Some of the other high winds included a wind gust of near 85 MPH in Madison County where a house had about one third of the shingles removed and a northeast facing overhang removed, 78 MPH in Tama, and 75 MPH at the Des Moines Airport, and 65 MPH in Carroll.  A downburst occurred in Marion County south-southwest of Pleasantville, with winds estimated to 60 MPH.  The storms were prolific rainfall producers.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was  common in central, into north central and parts of northeast Iowa.  Spotty reports of up to 6 inches in a 2 to 3 hour period were received.

Ground scouring/swirl marks noted along 1.9 mile track ending at the Phillips home on the SE corner of Norwalk where EF2 damage was observed. Tornado appeared to quickly dissipate on the NE of the home. Maximum path width 200 yards along the over 7 mile long track.  The second tornado was first verified over the Legacy Golf Course, just NW of the Norwalk Fire Station.  It is interesting to note the tornado passed directly over the fire station, producing a circular pattern in the gravel on the roof, and blowing out two overhead doors.  The tornado was narrow, with most damage consisting of tree damage up to EF1 and light structural damage as it moved to the SE.   The path width ranges from 10 yards to a maximum of approximately 100-150 yards.  This NW to SE tornado path crossed less than .25 miles of the path of the West to East moving Cumming to Norwalk Tornado.  A farmstead on R57 south of Coolidge St. sustained tree damage from tornado #2.  This is just south of the Phillips home that was damaged by the first tornado.  Winds were estimated at 125 MPH in the first tornado, and 100 MPH in the second.   Fortunately, there were no injuries during the tornado occurrences themselves, however one person was injured during recovery.  LCL levels were lower than the previous day, in the 750 to 1000 meter range.  As the complex evolved, the primary modes of severe weather were hail and high wind.  The freezing level was lower than the previous day, at 13,900 feet and many of the storms contained at least some hail.  The hail was not overly large, with most reports in the three quarter to one inch range.  During the storms evolution, there were several bow echo segments, resulting in high winds.  Winds of 80 MPH occurred southwest of Norwalk, in the rear flank downdraft of the supercell over the county in association with the tornadoes.  Some of the other high winds included a wind gust of near 85 MPH in Madison County where a house had about one third of the shingles removed and a northeast facing overhang removed, 78 MPH in Tama, and 75 MPH at the Des Moines Airport, and 65 MPH in Carroll.  A downburst occurred in Marion County south-southwest of Pleasantville, with winds estimated to 60 MPH.  The storms were prolific rainfall producers.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was  common in central, into north central and parts of northeast Iowa.  Spotty reports of up to 6 inches in a 2 to 3 hour period were received.

An outflow boundary from the previous nights convection pushed south across the CWA, reaching the southern part by sunrise.  This boundary combined with a quasi-stationary frontal boundary that was across the southern counties.  The atmosphere became unstable quite rapidly during the late morning and early afternoon.  Surface low pressure was located over southwest Iowa, with a warm front extending east  South of the warm front temperatures warmed to around 90 F. with dew points in the upper 60s to low 70s.  Surface based CAPE rose to 3000 to 4000 J/kg with the lifted index falling into the -8 to -10 C. range.  The cap broke by around 1800 UTC as an MCS began to develop over central Iowa.  The environment was fairly favorable with 30 to 40 kts of effective shear and precipitable water values around 1.5 inches.  Available cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  DCAPE values were between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Two tornadoes touched down in Warren County.  First indication of ground contact from the first tornado was adjacent to I-35 0.60 miles north of the Cumming, IA/G-14 interchange and approximately 1 mile NW of the town of Cumming.  Ground contact evident to the southeast along a path of approximately 125 degrees. First structural damage (EF1) noted at a farm house at G14 and 20th Ave.  Path width at this point estimated at 100 yards.  Continuous ground contact southeast to farmstead at G14 and 25th Ave where north facing garage was destroyed (EF1) and outbuildings and trailer damaged.  The tornado continued SE and reached widest point of approximately 200 yards striking outbuildings. Debris swath is noted to NE and also SE indicating the possibility of multi vortex circulation.  A farmstead at 30th Ave and Clark street sustained EF1 damage to grain bin and outbuildings. Path width approximately 150 yards. Corn from grain bin was noted well downstream at end of track, some corn impacted side of Phillips home in SE Norwalk.  Continuous ground contact ended and path narrowed considerably just north of Clarke St. near the Happy Apple Orchard. This resulted in a continuous tornado path of 2.2 miles.

A stationary front extended from the low, east-southeast into the northeast corner of Iowa.  Initial development took place over eastern South Dakota, with secondary development over eastern Iowa.  The area over South Dakota tracked southeast into northwest and north central Iowa, while the development over eastern Iowa tracked slowly south.  Initially, the thunderstorms over the northwest produced winds of 60 to 70 MPH, with one report of 80 MPH winds.  In the Armstrong area, 70 to 80 MPH winds rendered roadways impassible and tore gutters off of houses.  The area over the east produced mainly hail and heavy rain.  Hail up to softball size occurred in the Cedar Falls area, with baseball size hail in Black Hawk County near Waterloo.

Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches.

The clusters or short lines of storms moved east at a speed of about 30 knots (35 mph), and generated damaging downburst straight-line winds that toppled trees and power-lines, and heavy rains that triggered flash flooding.  Synoptically, a stationary front stretched from northern Iowa to Wisconsin/Illinois border.  Warm, moist, unstable air flowed north over the front in association with an upper-level short-wave trough, resulting in thunderstorm generation.  Hourly rainfall rates peaked around 2 inches.  By the end of August, 2007, many locations in south-central and southeast Wisconsin would establish new August rainfall records, and all-time/any month rainfall records.  Many locations measured 10 to over 20 inches for the month of August, 2007, or about 200% to over 400% of normal.  Normal August precipitation in southern Wisconsin is about 4 to 4.25 inches.  Unofficially, about 25 inches fell at a location 2W of Barneveld, Iowa County.

ID SAUI4.,"Strong winds aloft were in place over Iowa with a strong southwest flow of 35 to 55 kts in place through the lower and middle levels of the atmosphere.  A cold front approached Iowa from the west during the afternoon and evening hours.  The airmass was not all that unstable, with limited CAPE available for the event.  Most unstable CAPE values were in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range with shear values around 45 kts.  There was a decent amount of downdraft CAPE available, in the 1000 to 1200 J/kg range.  Morning convection complicated the weather situation by reducing the solar insulation across the area.  Eastern Iowa did clear out enough to allow temperatures to warm in to the mid 80s, along with dew point temperatures in the mid 60s.  A line of thunderstorms formed along this discontinuity during the last afternoon.  This line lifted northeast quite rapidly, producing high winds as it did.  A strong short wave lifted out of the southern plains during the late afternoon and evening hours.  This in combination with the approaching cold front resulted in a strong line of thunderstorms along the front in western Iowa.  As the storms advanced east, several small bow echo segments and meso-cyclones developed, resulting in high winds for parts of west central into central Iowa.  Both of the lines of storms featured high wind as the mode of severe weather.

Several different waves of thunderstorms formed and moved across the region beginning in the morning of the 17th and ending in the evening. Very strong wind shear had also developed through a large depth of the atmosphere, which supported organized thunderstorms and even supercells. The most widespread damage occurred as a result of a squall line that developed on the dry line to the west and moved into eastern Oklahoma during the early evening.

39612,6/27/2007 5:59,57,MG,The Automated Surface Observing System at Fort Stockton (KFST) recorded wind gusts to 66 mph.  No damage was reported.,"A strong squall line associated with a frontal boundary and weak upper level disturbance moved into the forecast area causing widespread severe weather and isolated flooding. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.  As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Bealls Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people.   As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area.  A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.  The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.  Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a “widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.”   While straight-line winds are common across West Texas – especially during the late spring and early summer – the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.  During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland’s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.

The tornado occurred on the east side of Hastings. This EF0 tornado traveled on the ground for about 1.5 miles and lifted around the Hastings Motorsports Track just southeast of town. Damage was minor. Elsewhere in Hastings, tree damage was excessive due to straight line winds near 70 mph. The hardest hit area was the eastern half of town where large trees were toppled and some damage was had to homes and other buildings. Hastings was the beginning of a corridor of high winds, which extended east along U.S. Highway 6 across Clay County and into Fillmore County. Another hard hit area was from Harvard to Saronville. A 125-foot tall grain bin was completely destroyed at a grain storage facility near Saronville. Ironically, the bin had just been completed. Over $100,000 in electrical equipment for the facility was lost as well. Winds were estimated at 80 mph and were enough to pull the anchor bolts out of the cement foundation. Further east, the town of Fairmont in Fillmore County was pounded as well. The roof was torn from the local car wash and tree damage was extensive. Power was lost to many parts of Fillmore County, including the Fillmore Central Middle School where classes were cancelled the next day. In rural areas, pivots were overturned, outbuildings damaged and the corn crop was trampled by the wind. Damage to corn and soybeans is hard to assess, but will likely reach several million dollars. Heavy rain of 2 to 5 inches resulted in water issues around the area as well. Many streets in Hastings were flooded and there were numerous road closures on county roads across Adams and Clay counties.

Temperatures were in the 90s with dew points in the 70s south of the boundary.  A strong upper level disturbance that moved across the state helped trigger thunderstorm development by mid afternoon as it brought a wind shift of drier air eastward to meet the unstable conditions.  Severe thunderstorms quickly developed and they congealed into several bow echo type configurations as they tracked across both the Lincoln and Omaha metro areas and then into southwest Iowa.  Moderate amounts of wind damage was reported with the activity along with scattered large hail reports.,41.17,-96.05

The roof at the Family Activity Center of the First Baptist Church in Kermit was severely damaged.,"A strong squall line associated with a frontal boundary and weak upper level disturbance moved into the forecast area causing widespread severe weather and isolated flooding. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.  As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Bealls Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people.   As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area.  A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.  The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.  Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a “widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.”   While straight-line winds are common across West Texas – especially during the late spring and early summer – the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.  During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland’s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.

A moist and unstable airmass ahead of the cold front provided the fuel to generate severe thunderstorms that included five tornadoes, near record-size hail and damaging winds.  Thousands of homes sustained damage and about 15,000 customers lost power during the storms, some for almost 3 days as trees blocked roads and slowed repair work to power lines.  Four people sustained minor injuries, and total damage from the storms exceeded $60 million.  The first tornado of the outbreak moved across eastern Marathon County shortly after 4:00 PM CDT, producing damage to several homes.  The tornado was rated EF2.  A second thunderstorm produced a weak tornado in Wood County, which was rated EF0.  The same storm responsible for this tornado produced softball size hail that damaged thousands of homes, several businesses and hundreds of vehicles.  One hailstone that fell in Port Edwards measured 5.50 inches in diameter, making it the second largest hailstone on record in Wisconsin.  The same supercell thunderstorm that produced the Marathon County tornado also produced a long-track tornado across northeast Shawano, northwest Menominee, southeast Langlade and northern Oconto counties.  This tornado was on the ground for 47 minutes, covering 40.1 miles, and destroyed 14,400 acres of woodlands (timber loss was estimated at $12.5 million) and dozens of buildings along its path.

South of the front, mid afternoon temperatures ranged in the mid 80s to lower 90s. To the north of the front, a meso-high had formed, with much cooler and drier air around it. The temperature across the boundary ranged from 89F at Minot, to 73F at Devils Lake, to 64F at Crookston. The upper air pattern had a western ridge and an eastern trough, putting the northern plains in northwest flow aloft. A strengthening upper jet also moved toward eastern North Dakota, giving this system good surface and upper level support.  A supercell thunderstorm developed over southern Steele County around 530 pm CST and tracked across western Cass County and into eastern Ransom County before weakening after 7 pm CST. Then, another supercell thunderstorm formed over northern Steele County around 725 pm CST. This storm tracked just west of the path of the first storm, again mainly hitting central Steele County, western Cass County, and eastern Ransom County, before weakening around 915 pm CST. Both thunderstorms tracked south-southeast at speeds between 40 and 50 mph and spawned multiple tornadoes which were embedded within the overall downburst wind and hail pattern.  The significant downburst wind and wind driven hail was seen in two partially overlapping paths, with each path from 5 to 7 miles wide and between 60 and 80 miles long (this damage path showed up clearly on satellite images). The strength of these winds is believed to have exceeded 80 mph with speeds over 100 mph in some localized areas. Hail sizes ranged from penny to hen egg sized.  Most areas received considerable hail damage at the same time as the strong winds. Law enforcement officials and witnesses stated that the hail often persisted for longer than 5 minutes and completely covered the ground. The hail damaged roofs, windows, and siding in many homes along the damage path. Stripped and decimated corn, bean, and wheat fields were typical along the entire storm path too.

There was a strong contrast across the front with highs in the low 90s south of the front with dew points in the low to mid 70s, and temperatures in the 60s and 70s north of the front.  The airmass was quite unstable with CAPE between 3000 and 4000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -6 to -8 C. range.  There was sufficient shear in place and was in the 35 to 50 kt range.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was 500 to 700 J/kg, however with freezing levels 15,000 to 15,500 feet hail was not realized in severe size at the ground level.  The LCL was between 1000 and 1500 meters along the lead edge of the thunderstorms.  As the front progressed southeast, a line of thunderstorms developed just ahead of the front.  They developed quite rapidly as the cap was broken.  The air was fairly dry in the lower levels leading to downdraft CAPE of 1000 to 1500 J/kg.    In spite of the dry layer at low levels, precipitable water values were quite high, in the 1.5 to 1.7 inch range.  Many of the storms remained below severe levels.  An upper level vorticity max lifted northeast across eastern Nebraska into western Iowa during the late afternoon and evening hours.  This intensified storms over eastern Nebraska, which moved into western Iowa.  The storms became severe and produced high winds and several tornadoes from west central into central Iowa.  The line took on a very evident bow echo as it moved through Crawford County, and that remained in tact as far east as Story County.

Tornadoes touched down in Carroll and Greene Counties.  They were short lived and were only on the ground for a short time in rural areas.  One of them touched down in Carroll County north of Dedham, while a short time later a second touched down north of Coon Rapids downing utility poles.  An aerial survey showed a very intermittent track, beginning about 3 miles north of Coon Rapids in Carroll County, continuing east for approximately 15 miles.  It dissipated in Greene County just west of Cooper.  Maximum path width was 50 yards.  Crop damage and power poles were bent but no structures were significantly impacted.  There was a two mile continuous swath of corn damage occurring about four miles west of Cooper with numerous meanders and turns.  EF0 damage ended at approximately 1825 PM CST.  Another tornado was on the ground for about 5 minutes in an intermittent track from southwest to south of Rippey.  Minor roof damage was done and some windows were blown out by the tornado southwest of Rippey.  Another tornado touched down in Guthrie County west of Bayard.  An aerial survey showed a 3/4 mile long track that was embedded in the west to east outflow of the storm.  A 50 yard wide track of damaged corn and a dozen trees downed at a farmstead were observed.  A few shingles were blown off the house, but otherwise no other significant building damage was noted.  The tornado was and EF0.

These winds were felt at the surface to some degree as a large area across the Lower Mississippi River Valley saw sustained winds between 25-35 mph with gusts between 40-50 mph. Those gradient winds, in advance of the severe weather, were strong enough to down some trees and power lines across the region. Those damage reports were more scattered in nature.

Ground contact evident to the southeast along a path of approximately 125 degrees. First structural damage (EF1) noted at a farm house at G14 and 20th Ave.  Path width at this point estimated at 100 yards.  Continuous ground contact southeast to farmstead at G14 and 25th Ave where north facing garage was destroyed (EF1) and outbuildings and trailer damaged.

A farmstead at 30th Ave and Clark street sustained EF1 damage to grain bin and outbuildings. Path width approximately 150 yards. Corn from grain bin was noted well downstream at end of track, some corn impacted side of Phillips home in SE Norwalk.  Continuous ground contact ended and path narrowed considerably just north of Clarke St. near the Happy Apple Orchard. This resulted in a continuous tornado path of 2.2 miles.  Intermittent damage path continued SE for 1.5 miles across fields and wooded areas with path of 30 to 50 yards. Next structural damage occurred to a light garage (EF0).  The track turned E/NE Approximately  080 degrees for .6 mile, with intermittent damage consisting of snapped and mangled trees. Path width 30 to 50 yards. Mature  2 diameter trees along farm pond snapped at trunk and tops of trees deposited to the NE. The track turns SE for .75 mile before again turning E/NE.  Narrow swath of tree damage noted.  The track continues ENE (approximately 070 degrees) across Highway 28 where EF0 damage was noted. Ground scouring/swirl marks noted along 1.9 mile track ending at the Phillips home on the SE corner of Norwalk where EF2 damage was observed. Tornado appeared to quickly dissipate on the NE of the home. Maximum path width 200 yards along the over 7 mile long track.  The second tornado was first verified over the Legacy Golf Course, just NW of the Norwalk Fire Station.  It is interesting to note the tornado passed directly over the fire station, producing a circular pattern in the gravel on the roof, and blowing out two overhead doors.  The tornado was narrow, with most damage consisting of tree damage up to EF1 and light structural damage as it moved to the SE.   The path width ranges from 10 yards to a maximum of approximately 100-150 yards.

28276,6/22/2007 22:11,65,MG,nan,"A rather complex weather situation unfolded during the day on the 22nd.  The situation was complicated by the convection that occurred during the previous night.  An outflow boundary from the previous nights convection pushed south across the CWA, reaching the southern part by sunrise.  This boundary combined with a quasi-stationary frontal boundary that was across the southern counties.  The atmosphere became unstable quite rapidly during the late morning and early afternoon.  Surface low pressure was located over southwest Iowa, with a warm front extending east  South of the warm front temperatures warmed to around 90 F. with dew points in the upper 60s to low 70s.  Surface based CAPE rose to 3000 to 4000 J/kg with the lifted index falling into the -8 to -10 C. range.  The cap broke by around 1800 UTC as an MCS began to develop over central Iowa.  The environment was fairly favorable with 30 to 40 kts of effective shear and precipitable water values around 1.5 inches.  Available cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  DCAPE values were between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Two tornadoes touched down in Warren County.  First indication of ground contact from the first tornado was adjacent to I-35 0.60 miles north of the Cumming, IA/G-14 interchange and approximately 1 mile NW of the town of Cumming.  Ground contact evident to the southeast along a path of approximately 125 degrees. First structural damage (EF1) noted at a farm house at G14 and 20th Ave.  Path width at this point estimated at 100 yards.  Continuous ground contact southeast to farmstead at G14 and 25th Ave where north facing garage was destroyed (EF1) and outbuildings and trailer damaged.  The tornado continued SE and reached widest point of approximately 200 yards striking outbuildings. Debris swath is noted to NE and also SE indicating the possibility of multi vortex circulation.  A farmstead at 30th Ave and Clark street sustained EF1 damage to grain bin and outbuildings. Path width approximately 150 yards. Corn from grain bin was noted well downstream at end of track, some corn impacted side of Phillips home in SE Norwalk.  Continuous ground contact ended and path narrowed considerably just north of Clarke St. near the Happy Apple Orchard. This resulted in a continuous tornado path of 2.2 miles.  Intermittent damage path continued SE for 1.5 miles across fields and wooded areas with path of 30 to 50 yards. Next structural damage occurred to a light garage (EF0).  The track turned E/NE Approximately  080 degrees for .6 mile, with intermittent damage consisting of snapped and mangled trees. Path width 30 to 50 yards. Mature  2 diameter trees along farm pond snapped at trunk and tops of trees deposited to the NE. The track turns SE for .75 mile before again turning E/NE.  Narrow swath of tree damage noted.  The track continues ENE (approximately 070 degrees) across Highway 28 where EF0 damage was noted. Ground scouring/swirl marks noted along 1.9 mile track ending at the Phillips home on the SE corner of Norwalk where EF2 damage was observed. Tornado appeared to quickly dissipate on the NE of the home. Maximum path width 200 yards along the over 7 mile long track.  The second tornado was first verified over the Legacy Golf Course, just NW of the Norwalk Fire Station.  It is interesting to note the tornado passed directly over the fire station, producing a circular pattern in the gravel on the roof, and blowing out two overhead doors.  The tornado was narrow, with most damage consisting of tree damage up to EF1 and light structural damage as it moved to the SE.   The path width ranges from 10 yards to a maximum of approximately 100-150 yards.  This NW to SE tornado path crossed less than .25 miles of the path of the West to East moving Cumming to Norwalk Tornado.  A farmstead on R57 south of Coolidge St. sustained tree damage from tornado #2.  This is just south of the Phillips home that was damaged by the first tornado.  Winds were estimated at 125 MPH in the first tornado, and 100 MPH in the second.   Fortunately, there were no injuries during the tornado occurrences themselves, however one person was injured during recovery.  LCL levels were lower than the previous day, in the 750 to 1000 meter range.  As the complex evolved, the primary modes of severe weather were hail and high wind.  The freezing level was lower than the previous day, at 13,900 feet and many of the storms contained at least some hail.  The hail was not overly large, with most reports in the three quarter to one inch range.  During the storms evolution, there were several bow echo segments, resulting in high winds.  Winds of 80 MPH occurred southwest of Norwalk, in the rear flank downdraft of the supercell over the county in association with the tornadoes.  Some of the other high winds included a wind gust of near 85 MPH in Madison County where a house had about one third of the shingles removed and a northeast facing overhang removed, 78 MPH in Tama, and 75 MPH at the Des Moines Airport, and 65 MPH in Carroll.  A downburst occurred in Marion County south-southwest of Pleasantville, with winds estimated to 60 MPH.  The storms were prolific rainfall producers.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was  common in central, into north central and parts of northeast Iowa.  Spotty reports of up to 6 inches in a 2 to 3 hour period were received.

Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches. Rivers and creeks easily exceeded their banks, with water also rising quickly in many towns.

A tree limb went through a company vehicle.","A strong squall line associated with a frontal boundary and weak upper level disturbance moved into the forecast area causing widespread severe weather and isolated flooding. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.  As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Bealls Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people.   As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area.  A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.  The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.  Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a “widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.”   While straight-line winds are common across West Texas – especially during the late spring and early summer – the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.  During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland’s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.

As the instability advected east along this area of isentropic lift, thunderstorms rapidly developed. Due to the slow movement of these storms as well as precipitable water values at or above 2 inches, widepsread heavy rain was observed in many locations. With northwest flow aloft, the line drifted south and accelerated as a wave approached the area. While flooding ended up the main threat, embedded wind damage was observed in a few of the stronger storms.",41.6088,-86.7082

This system was dynamic enough to generate a line of thunderstorms across Central Mississippi. This line developed within a strongly sheared environment and evolved into a squall line with bowing segments. These bowing segments proved very efficient with respect to producing damaging wind gusts and six tornadoes. The squall line matured just east of Interstate 55 around 11 pm and raced east before exiting into Alabama around 3 am.",32.37,-88.72

28295,6/23/2007 0:47,68,MG,nan,"A rather complex weather situation unfolded during the day on the 22nd.  The situation was complicated by the convection that occurred during the previous night.  An outflow boundary from the previous nights convection pushed south across the CWA, reaching the southern part by sunrise.  This boundary combined with a quasi-stationary frontal boundary that was across the southern counties.  The atmosphere became unstable quite rapidly during the late morning and early afternoon.  Surface low pressure was located over southwest Iowa, with a warm front extending east  South of the warm front temperatures warmed to around 90 F. with dew points in the upper 60s to low 70s.  Surface based CAPE rose to 3000 to 4000 J/kg with the lifted index falling into the -8 to -10 C. range.  The cap broke by around 1800 UTC as an MCS began to develop over central Iowa.  The environment was fairly favorable with 30 to 40 kts of effective shear and precipitable water values around 1.5 inches.  Available cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  DCAPE values were between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Two tornadoes touched down in Warren County.  First indication of ground contact from the first tornado was adjacent to I-35 0.60 miles north of the Cumming, IA/G-14 interchange and approximately 1 mile NW of the town of Cumming.  Ground contact evident to the southeast along a path of approximately 125 degrees. First structural damage (EF1) noted at a farm house at G14 and 20th Ave.  Path width at this point estimated at 100 yards.  Continuous ground contact southeast to farmstead at G14 and 25th Ave where north facing garage was destroyed (EF1) and outbuildings and trailer damaged.  The tornado continued SE and reached widest point of approximately 200 yards striking outbuildings. Debris swath is noted to NE and also SE indicating the possibility of multi vortex circulation.  A farmstead at 30th Ave and Clark street sustained EF1 damage to grain bin and outbuildings. Path width approximately 150 yards. Corn from grain bin was noted well downstream at end of track, some corn impacted side of Phillips home in SE Norwalk.  Continuous ground contact ended and path narrowed considerably just north of Clarke St. near the Happy Apple Orchard. This resulted in a continuous tornado path of 2.2 miles.  Intermittent damage path continued SE for 1.5 miles across fields and wooded areas with path of 30 to 50 yards. Next structural damage occurred to a light garage (EF0).  The track turned E/NE Approximately  080 degrees for .6 mile, with intermittent damage consisting of snapped and mangled trees. Path width 30 to 50 yards. Mature  2 diameter trees along farm pond snapped at trunk and tops of trees deposited to the NE. The track turns SE for .75 mile before again turning E/NE.  Narrow swath of tree damage noted.  The track continues ENE (approximately 070 degrees) across Highway 28 where EF0 damage was noted. Ground scouring/swirl marks noted along 1.9 mile track ending at the Phillips home on the SE corner of Norwalk where EF2 damage was observed. Tornado appeared to quickly dissipate on the NE of the home. Maximum path width 200 yards along the over 7 mile long track.  The second tornado was first verified over the Legacy Golf Course, just NW of the Norwalk Fire Station.  It is interesting to note the tornado passed directly over the fire station, producing a circular pattern in the gravel on the roof, and blowing out two overhead doors.  The tornado was narrow, with most damage consisting of tree damage up to EF1 and light structural damage as it moved to the SE.   The path width ranges from 10 yards to a maximum of approximately 100-150 yards.  This NW to SE tornado path crossed less than .25 miles of the path of the West to East moving Cumming to Norwalk Tornado.  A farmstead on R57 south of Coolidge St. sustained tree damage from tornado #2.  This is just south of the Phillips home that was damaged by the first tornado.  Winds were estimated at 125 MPH in the first tornado, and 100 MPH in the second.   Fortunately, there were no injuries during the tornado occurrences themselves, however one person was injured during recovery.  LCL levels were lower than the previous day, in the 750 to 1000 meter range.  As the complex evolved, the primary modes of severe weather were hail and high wind.  The freezing level was lower than the previous day, at 13,900 feet and many of the storms contained at least some hail.  The hail was not overly large, with most reports in the three quarter to one inch range.  During the storms evolution, there were several bow echo segments, resulting in high winds.  Winds of 80 MPH occurred southwest of Norwalk, in the rear flank downdraft of the supercell over the county in association with the tornadoes.  Some of the other high winds included a wind gust of near 85 MPH in Madison County where a house had about one third of the shingles removed and a northeast facing overhang removed, 78 MPH in Tama, and 75 MPH at the Des Moines Airport, and 65 MPH in Carroll.  A downburst occurred in Marion County south-southwest of Pleasantville, with winds estimated to 60 MPH.  The storms were prolific rainfall producers.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was  common in central, into north central and parts of northeast Iowa.  Spotty reports of up to 6 inches in a 2 to 3 hour period were received.

The clusters or short lines of storms moved east at a speed of about 30 knots (35 mph), and generated damaging downburst straight-line winds that toppled trees and power-lines, and heavy rains that triggered flash flooding.  Synoptically, a stationary front stretched from northern Iowa to Wisconsin/Illinois border.  Warm, moist, unstable air flowed north over the front in association with an upper-level short-wave trough, resulting in thunderstorm generation.  Hourly rainfall rates peaked around 2 inches.  By the end of August, 2007, many locations in south-central and southeast Wisconsin would establish new August rainfall records, and all-time/any month rainfall records.  Many locations measured 10 to over 20 inches for the month of August, 2007, or about 200% to over 400% of normal.  Normal August precipitation in southern Wisconsin is about 4 to 4.25 inches.  Unofficially, about 25 inches fell at a location 2W of Barneveld, Iowa County.

The tornado occurred on the east side of Hastings. This EF0 tornado traveled on the ground for about 1.5 miles and lifted around the Hastings Motorsports Track just southeast of town. Damage was minor. Elsewhere in Hastings, tree damage was excessive due to straight line winds near 70 mph. The hardest hit area was the eastern half of town where large trees were toppled and some damage was had to homes and other buildings. Hastings was the beginning of a corridor of high winds, which extended east along U.S. Highway 6 across Clay County and into Fillmore County. Another hard hit area was from Harvard to Saronville. A 125-foot tall grain bin was completely destroyed at a grain storage facility near Saronville. Ironically, the bin had just been completed. Over $100,000 in electrical equipment for the facility was lost as well. Winds were estimated at 80 mph and were enough to pull the anchor bolts out of the cement foundation. Further east, the town of Fairmont in Fillmore County was pounded as well. The roof was torn from the local car wash and tree damage was extensive. Power was lost to many parts of Fillmore County, including the Fillmore Central Middle School where classes were cancelled the next day. In rural areas, pivots were overturned, outbuildings damaged and the corn crop was trampled by the wind. Damage to corn and soybeans is hard to assess, but will likely reach several million dollars. Heavy rain of 2 to 5 inches resulted in water issues around the area as well. Many streets in Hastings were flooded and there were numerous road closures on county roads across Adams and Clay counties. There were sporadic reports of large hail and high winds elsewhere in south central Nebraska that afternoon and evening.

South of the front, mid afternoon temperatures ranged in the mid 80s to lower 90s. To the north of the front, a meso-high had formed, with much cooler and drier air around it. The temperature across the boundary ranged from 89F at Minot, to 73F at Devils Lake, to 64F at Crookston. The upper air pattern had a western ridge and an eastern trough, putting the northern plains in northwest flow aloft. A strengthening upper jet also moved toward eastern North Dakota, giving this system good surface and upper level support.  A supercell thunderstorm developed over southern Steele County around 530 pm CST and tracked across western Cass County and into eastern Ransom County before weakening after 7 pm CST. Then, another supercell thunderstorm formed over northern Steele County around 725 pm CST. This storm tracked just west of the path of the first storm, again mainly hitting central Steele County, western Cass County, and eastern Ransom County, before weakening around 915 pm CST. Both thunderstorms tracked south-southeast at speeds between 40 and 50 mph and spawned multiple tornadoes which were embedded within the overall downburst wind and hail pattern.  The significant downburst wind and wind driven hail was seen in two partially overlapping paths, with each path from 5 to 7 miles wide and between 60 and 80 miles long (this damage path showed up clearly on satellite images). The strength of these winds is believed to have exceeded 80 mph with speeds over 100 mph in some localized areas. Hail sizes ranged from penny to hen egg sized.  Most areas received considerable hail damage at the same time as the strong winds. Law enforcement officials and witnesses stated that the hail often persisted for longer than 5 minutes and completely covered the ground. The hail damaged roofs, windows, and siding in many homes along the damage path. Stripped and decimated corn, bean, and wheat fields were typical along the entire storm path too. The ND Farm Service Administration estimated losses occurred on over 700,000 acres in five counties. Total crop losses may exceed $250 million, with other property losses from $15 to $20 million.

Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.  As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Bealls Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people.   As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area.  A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.  The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.  Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a “widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.”   While straight-line winds are common across West Texas – especially during the late spring and early summer – the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.  During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland’s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.

Winds were measured at 97.5 mph at the West Texas Mesonet site two miles north northeast of Seminole, however, there is visual indication that wind speeds in some locations around Seminole, were at times even stronger – estimated in the range of 100-120 mph. Communication tower damage, where a tower measuring 320 feet in height fell on a church and another tall tower was bent into the shape of a rectangle, both suggest higher wind speed estimates. Additionally, three miles east southeast of Seminole along County Road 402, at least eight wooden power poles were snapped just above the ground. This further supports the idea that winds were at times greater than 100 mph.  NWS personnel found many trees were uprooted and tree limbs down. The entire town of Seminole experienced damage, with areas just west of downtown and just east of town being hardest hit by the damaging winds.  The extent of the wind damage prompted the Gaines County EOC to request EMS/Fire assistance from Hobbs, NM. Included in the damage were two mobile homes that were rolled.  One of these homes had four people inside, including one infant.  All four were injured and the infant was kept for observation overnight at a Lubbock hospital.

A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.  As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Bealls Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people.   As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area.  A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.  The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.  Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a “widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.”   While straight-line winds are common across West Texas – especially during the late spring and early summer – the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.  During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland’s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.  Summary of measured wind reports:  Dryden (K6R6) - 55 kts (63 mph) Big Spring (KBPG) - 51 kts (59 mph) Fort Stockton (KFST) - 57 kts (66 mph) Guadalupe Pass (KGDP) - 62 kts (71 mph) Wink (KINK) - 58 kts (67 mph) Midland (KMAF) - 81 kts (93 mph)* Odessa (KODO) - 55 kts (63 mph) Seagraves 1 SW (KSGV) - 66 kts (76 mph) Andrews 2 E (KANS) - 51 kts (59 mph)* Seminole 2 NNE (KSMS) - 85 kts (98 mph)* Lamesa 2 SE (KLES) - 45 kts (52 mph)* Gail 2 ESE (KGGS) - 43 kts (50 mph)* Pecos (KPEQ) - 56 kts (64 mph) McDonald Observatory - 61 kts (70 mph) Tatum, NM Co-op Observer - 68 kts (78 mph)  *These sites lost power shortly after observations, it may be assumed that peak wind gusts were somewhat higher than observed.",32.72,-102.65

A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.   As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Bealls Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people.   As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area. A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.   The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.   Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a “widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.”   While straight-line winds are common across West Texas – especially during the late spring and early summer – the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.   During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland’s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.

27891,6/17/2007 0:12,77,MG,See entire episode narrative for full details.,"During the late afternoon and evening of June 16, 2007, a high precipitation supercell thunderstorm tracked from across northern Montana, just to the north of a warm front.  This was the most devastating hail storm to affect the area since at least 1999, and prompted 22 severe thunderstorm and 6 tornado warnings in the NWS Glasgow county warning area. The storm began early in the day just east of Glacier National Park and gradually moved hundreds of miles eastward through the day.  By 3 pm, the storm crossed into the NWS Glasgow area in Phillips County, where it started to make a turn to the southeast.   The storm traveled for over 250 miles before decreasing in Richland County near the North Dakota border a little after 11 pm.  Hail up to baseball size and wind gusts in excess of 85 mph accompanied the storm.  Torrential heavy rainfall was also experienced, prompting seven flash flood warnings to be issued.  The large hail left a hail swath seen on GOES and Terra MODIS satellites that had a path at least 225 miles long, and up to 12 miles wide.   The most significant damage from the storm occurred in portions of Valley and McCone Counties.  The towns of Glasgow and Nashua, both in Valley County, took a direct hit from the storm.  In Glasgow, southeast winds gusting to 60 to 65 mph ahead of the storm switched into the northwest with gusts in excess of 70 mph.  Golfball to baseball sized hail fell for several minutes before diminishing to penny sized for another 10-20 minutes.  The majority of the homes and businesses in Glasgow had some sort of damage including:  broken windows, damaged shingles, dented or broken gutters and skirting.  Many vehicles also had significant hail damage.  Just the property damage alone in Glasgow was nearly $8.0 million dollars.  As the storm continued east it hit the town of Nashua and every home and business had some form of damage from the baseball size hail and the damaging winds that occurred with it.   The winds were measured at 89 mph just west of town.  Property damage was estimated to be $3 million dollars.    In rural areas outside of Glasgow and Nashua there were several cottonwood trees completely uprooted.  Horses and cattle were injured by the hail and wind, and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks reported many birds and small animals were killed by the hail.  There were thousands of acres of alfalfa, wheat, and corn that were completely destroyed.  At this time, damage estimates to crops in Valley County are at $20 million dollars.  The storm also produced heavy rainfall of 1 to 2 inches, and was followed later in the evening by additional heavy rain.  Rainfall of 2 to 7 inches fell in the Antelope, Brazil and Willow Creek basins.  The Antelope Creek basin had its most significant flood on record and one road was completely underwater for nearly a third of a mile.  One ranch was isolated by the flood waters for three days.   As the storm continued across northern McCone County and into western Richland County it continued to produce hail up to the size of ping pong balls and wind gusts that were estimated as high as 80 to 90 mph knocked down telephone and electrical poles.   There was significant damage to farms and ranches in the Vida area, as well as significant loss of crops, estimated at $5 million dollars.  The rural nature of the area minimized the property damage that could have occurred.    The overall estimated damage in this storm between the hail and wind damage, and the subsequent flooding is 34.2 million dollars.",48.0923,-106.45
