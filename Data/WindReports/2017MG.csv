This MCS moved into Middle Tennessee around 230 PM CDT, and additional scattered thunderstorms also developed out ahead of the MCS. Numerous reports of large hail and damaging winds were received with these storms before all of the storms exited the area by early evening.  Due to high amounts of instability in the atmosphere and unusually steep lapse rates aloft, very large hail was reported in several areas. Some of the largest hail was reported in Lewisburg, where hail up to 2 inches in diameter covered the ground and caused significant damage to roofs and vehicles. Golf ball size hail was also reported in Waynesboro (Wayne County), with ping pong ball size hail in Hampshire (Maury County) and Summertown (Lawrence County).  Some of the worst wind damage occurred along a segment of the MCS called a bow echo, which is commonly associated with damaging winds. This bow echo moved from Williamson and Rutherford Counties across Cannon, Coffee, Warren, Van Buren, and Grundy Counties during the late afternoon hours.

Scattered single cell thunderstorms began developing around 3 PM CST from central Kansas northeast into southern Nebraska. The formation of numerous cells quickly resulted in a transition to a multicell convective mode by 4 PM CST. This nearly continuous line of storms lifted north, crossing much of south central Nebraska between 5 and 8 PM CST. As this occurred, another cluster of multicells over north central Kansas merged and moved northeast, eventually taking on the shape of a bow echo. This line of storms affected areas from Nelson and Hebron up to York between 630 and 730 PM CST. More storms over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas eventually consolidated and crossed south central Nebraska as a small scale bow echo between 10 PM and 130 AM CST. The initial line lifting north produced a fairly large area of severe winds from the state line north to Holdrege and Grand Island. A grain bin was removed from its foundation and deposited on Highway 74 near the town of Roseland, in Adams County. A tractor-trailer was blown over on Interstate 80 as well, just south of Grand Island. The highest gust measured was 67 mph at the Holdrege airport. A brief EF-0 landspout tornado was photographed near the town of Exeter. The eastern portion of this line produced the most hail, with a few reports of 1 inch hail over Fillmore, Nuckolls, and Thayer Counties. The bow echo taking shape from Nelson to York snapped a few power poles in eastern Thayer County. The last line of storms to cross the area produced mostly sub-severe winds of 50 to 55 mph. However, severe winds did occur in a couple locations. The highest measured gust was 64 mph in the town of Norman, in eastern Kearney County. A brief EF-1 tornado also occurred in Clay County, just north of the town of Edgar. It was on the ground for approximately 2 miles, damaging outbuildings, trees, and overturning irrigation pivots. This tornado occurred just after midnight CST. Repeated thunderstorm activity resulted in 1 to 2 inches of rain over much of south central Nebraska.

An upper low was over North Dakota while upper ridging was over northern Mexico.  A shortwave passing over the northern part of the ridge put West Texas in westerly winds aloft and provided some upper level support for thunderstorms.  Good moisture east of the dryline, strong heating at the surface with temperatures in the upper 90s to 100s, and high lapse rates lead to very strong instability.  Those parameters in combination with wind shear attributed to organized thunderstorm development.  These thunderstorms were not supercells, instead they were extremely strong multicellular thunderstorms with tops exceeding 60,000 feet.  These severe storms produced very large hail and damaging winds as they moved across parts of the Permian Basin, impacting the highly populated cities of Midland and Odessa.  Odessa received the largest hail and strongest winds.     The thunderstorms began to weaken as they moved into the City of Midland.

While the vast majority of this activity was sub-severe, there were two reports meeting severe-criteria. First of all, during the first of the three rounds during the pre-dawn hours of the 28th, a storm briefly intensified around 1 a.m. CDT, producing a wind gust of 58 MPH at Rooks County Regional Airport. This round of convection moved out of the local area by sunrise, followed by several hours of storm-free weather through the day. Then, around sunset on the 28th, another round of convection erupted over eastern portions of the area, with radar indicative of severe weather potential mainly within Mitchell and Jewell counties. The only ground-truth report from this activity consisted of quarter size hail near Beloit around 10 p.m. CDT. As this round eventually weakened and/or drifted eastward into northeast Kansas, yet another cluster of storms moved in from the west after 3:30 a.m. CDT on the 29th, with radar again indicative of at least marginally severe hail and/or wind within parts of the area. However, the only ground-truth report consisted of sub-severe dime size hail in Stockton around 4 a.m. CDT, with this entire North Central Kansas area again storm-free by 7:30 a.m. CDT.   These rounds of nocturnal convection were very typical of late-June, with the mid-upper levels featuring quasi-zonal flow and a series of passing, low-amplitude shortwave troughs. On both nights/early mornings, a strong southerly low level jet (evident per 850 millibar analysis) aided convective initiation/sustainment. At the surface, all of this activity occurred in the vicinity of a slow-moving front meandering over the region.

704399,6/14/2017 3:05,51,MG,nan,"In what had been a slower-than-average severe weather season up to this point within South Central Nebraska, this Tuesday evening event ended up being one of the most significant episodes of the 2017 season. Primarily between 6:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, a rash of severe storms consisting of semi-discrete supercells and quasi-linear clusters yielded dozens of large hail and damaging wind reports, including hail to at least tennis ball size in/very near both Grand Island and Hastings. Despite its significance, this was not a tremendously widespread event in terms of areal coverage, as the vast majority of severe weather focused within a relatively narrow, 30-50 mile wide corridor centered roughly through the Red Cloud-Hastings-Grand Island-Aurora-Osceola areas.   Severe reports were split fairly evenly between hail and damaging winds. Hail was the bigger issue in western portions of the affected areas, with wind damage more of a factor farther east. Focusing first on hail, one of the biggest stories involved both the Grand Island and Hastings areas getting pelted within the same hour. In Grand Island, much of the city saw stones ranging from quarter to tennis ball size. In Hastings, the majority of the city itself observed quarter to golf ball size hail. However, a corridor running from just a few miles southwest-through-west of the city limits endured larger hail up to baseball size. As for damaging winds, the overall-worst impacts focused within counties east of Highway 281. In west-central Polk County, a personal weather station clocked an unofficial gust of 92 MPH, with gusts of at least 70 MPH also reported in the Clay Center, Bradshaw and Guide Rock areas. Many other locations had estimated or measured gusts in the 58-65 MPH range. Needless to say, there was a considerable amount of mainly minor tree and structural damage, including within the communities of Osceola, Shelby and Hordville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported, although storm chasers witnessed gustnado activity along the leading edge of surging outflow. Rainfall-wise, most places received no more than 1-2 from the evening of the 13th into the early morning of the 14th. However, the primary higher exception focused within southeastern Franklin and southwestern Webster counties, where a localized maximum of 3-4 fell in the Inavale and Riverton areas.   Breaking down timing, the first severe storms of the evening erupted along a fairly narrow, southwest-northeast corridor between 6:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, during which time both Grand Island and Hastings were hit with the large hail. Over the following hour, damaging winds became the main issue as outflow surged east, especially within Polk, Hamilton and York counties. Then, between 8:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, the initial wave of severe storms exited northeast portions of the local area while a second round erupted farther south, mainly impacting Webster, Clay and Nuckolls counties. Although the severe weather threat ended by 11 p.m. CDT, quite a bit of thunderstorm activity redeveloped through the night within various portions of South Central Nebraska.    In the mid-upper levels, this event was driven by a shortwave trough swinging east through the Central Plains, to the southeast of its parent closed low centered over Montana. At the surface, early evening storm initiation clearly focused along a composite stationary front/dryline stretched north-south through central Nebraska, attendant to a surface low pressure center that deepened to 998 millibars during the late afternoon hours. To the east of this dryline, afternoon high temperatures well into the 90s F combined with dewpoints in the upper 50s-mid 60s resulted in mixed-layer CAPE values of at least 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of 0-6 kilometer shear increasing to 40-50 knots as the evening progressed.",40.1386,-98.1504

Sporadic wind damage was the main issue, as although not all places observed severe-criteria winds (many sites only peaked in the 45-55 MPH range), some locations saw stronger gusts measured or estimated to at least 60-70 MPH. However, no community was harder hit than Genoa on the extreme eastern edge of the local area. Shortly after 11:30 p.m. CDT, a microburst with estimated 70-90 MPH winds slammed into town, causing considerable wind damage over several city blocks. This included many downed trees and large branches, along with structural damage to both residences and businesses. A lumberyard lost a portion of the front of its building and a section of roof was lifted off the post office. One home had twigs embedded into its siding. While Genoa sustained the overall-worst damage in South Central Nebraska, a sampling of other wind reports included: trees downed in and near Boelus and measured gusts of 70 MPH at Grand Island airport, 62 MPH near Ravenna and 61 MPH at Lexington airport.     Severe storms initially fired up in western Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours and started tracking east. Between 9-10 p.m. CDT, the leading edge of the maturing, strong-to-severe squall line entered the local area into Dawson County. Over the following few hours, this storm complex accelerated eastward while assuming a generally north-northeast to south-southwest orientation. By 1 a.m. CDT, the severe threat had waned as the squall line departed to the east/weakened, although non-severe activity lingered a few more hours within South Central Nebraska before completely ending for the night.   This was a fairly well-anticipated event, as the Storm Prediction Center upgraded the Day 1 severe threat category to Enhanced Risk (level 3-of-5) during the morning hours.

Resulting storms quickly went supercellular and proceeded to produce multiple tornadoes and large hail in excess of 2.5 inches throughout central and southwest Iowa. Seven tornadoes occurred across mainly rural portions of southwest into central Iowa in this event. The longest tornado was an EF1 tornado that touched down in Warren County and crossed into Marion County that was on the ground for over 17 miles. Much of the tornado  moved through rural portions of Warren and Marion Counties, but one farmstead received damage along the Warren/Marion County line with additional light damage to rural residences in Marion County.

As for hail, the largest reported stones up to ping pong size fell in Cozad and near Johnson Lake, with half dollar size hail reported in Gothenburg and near Holbrook. As for severe winds, a mesonet station near Cambridge measured a peak of 68 MPH and a storm chaser near Arapahoe clocked a 65 MPH gust.

Timing-wise, the first severe storms of the night to affect the local area drifted into Dawson County from the north between 9:00-10:30 p.m. CDT, including an embedded supercell in the western half of the county. For the next several hours, this storm expanded into a small-scale severe cluster as it trudged slowly southward through Gosper and Furnas counties, eventually weakening/dissipating near the KS border around 2 a.m. CDT.

Scattered multicell thunderstorms began forming early, just after noon CST, north of McCook. As these storms moved northeast, they were rapidly joined by numerous other storms. By 5 PM CST, scattered thunderstorms covered south central Nebraska, south of Interstate 80 between Highways 283 and 281. Over time, the most potent cells were the newest ones forming on the southwest edge of the expanding rain shield. By 6 PM CST, cell mergers there resulted in a short northeast-southwest oriented line segment of storms along the Furnas-Harlan County border. This line moved southeast into northern Kansas. As this occurred, and through the evening, more scattered storms continued to form to the west and southwest of the departing rain shield. By 1200 AM CST, the southwest edge of the precipitation area began moving northeast across the rest of south central Nebraska, with the strongest storms eventually becoming focused only on the southwest edge once again. By 4 AM CST, a multicellular line had formed from just east of Kearney to Hastings to Nelson, with a large shield of stratiform rain downstream. This line collapsed from northwest to southeast, weakened, and exited south central Nebraska around 7 AM CST Tuesday. Repeated cell development resulted in heavy rainfall amounts with 2 inch amounts common along Interstate 80 from Lexington to Grand Island. The heaviest amounts were south of Highway 6, especially along and just north of Highway 136, across Furnas, Harlan, Franklin, Webster, and Nuckolls Counties, where 3 to 5 inches fell. The highest amount was 5.55 inches in the town of Wilcox. Flood warnings were issued and minor flooding did occur along parts of the Republican River near Guide Rock. Flooding also occurred along Thompson Creek, with the gauge at Riverton briefly rising to moderate flood stage. It is likely that parts of Riverton did experience some flooding, but no impacts were received. A couple storms produced isolated severe weather, with 58 mph winds measured near Red Cloud, and hail the size of nickels in Wilcox.  These storms all formed in the warm sector of a deep low pressure system which was over central Canada. Its slow-moving cool front was over the Dakotas and the northern Rockies, while its warm front was east of the region, over Minnesota and Iowa. In the upper-levels, a subtropical high was over Oklahoma and encompassed the middle of the Country. The westerlies extended from the Pacific Northwest to Hudson Bay, with a weak trough over the eastern U.S. As the initial thunderstorms developed, temperatures were in the lower 90s, with dewpoints in the 60s. Mid-level lapse rates were low, resulting in MLCAPE generally between 1000 and 1900 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was around 20 kts. The persistent thunderstorm development, particularly in the evening and overnight hours was associated with a 45 kt low-level jet.

As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms.   After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County.   A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities.

Over the following few hours, this storm complex accelerated eastward while assuming a generally north-northeast to south-southwest orientation. By 1 a.m. CDT, the severe threat had waned as the squall line departed to the east/weakened, although non-severe activity lingered a few more hours within South Central Nebraska before completely ending for the night.   This was a fairly well-anticipated event, as the Storm Prediction Center upgraded the Day 1 severe threat category to Enhanced Risk (level 3-of-5) during the morning hours. In the mid-upper levels, the pattern was very favorable/typical for summer severe weather, featuring quasi-zonal flow and a respectable, small-scale shortwave trough tracking east across Nebraska over the course of the afternoon and evening. At the surface, low pressure centered over the Dakotas deepened to around 998 millibars by early evening. As a result, southerly breezes across South Central Nebraska averaged 15-25 MPH during the day with higher gusts, allowing a warm front to surge north. By early evening, dewpoints had increased into the mid-60s to low-70s F range ahead of a north-south oriented cold front slowly approaching from the west. As the MCS peaked in intensity over South Central Nebraska, the environment featured mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg and effective deep layer wind shear around 40 knots, with a strong low level jet of 50-60 knots feeding in from the south.",40.97,-99.08

714467,8/27/2017 10:24,52,MG,nan,"The pre-dawn hours of this Sunday featured a surprisingly-potent, southward-surging complex of severe thunderstorms that provoked considerable wind damage primarily within Sherman, Buffalo, Howard and Hall counties, and likely isolated wind damage in several nearby counties as well. Some of the worst impacts occurred in and near Ravenna, where estimated gusts to around 85 MPH downed numerous trees, some as large as 4-6 feet in diameter. Portions of the community were without power for several hours, and a few homes and vehicles also sustained damage. In Kearney, while damage was not widespread, three large trees crashed down on a trailer home causing substantial roof damage. Other communities that suffered wind damage (mainly to trees) included: Loup City, Pleasanton, Cairo, Boelus and Grand Island (although impacts were quite minimal on the grounds of the ongoing Nebraska State Fair). Once storms pushed south of the Interstate 80 corridor, most peak gusts checked in around or below 50 MPH, although a mesonet station near Nelson clocked a 60 MPH gust shortly before the strongest part of the complex departed southward into Kansas. As for rainfall, the majority of South Central Nebraska received at least 0.50-1.00, but localized pockets of mainly Valley, Sherman and Howard counties tallied 2+.   Breaking down event timing and evolution, the late evening featured a smattering of fairly weak storms here and there. However, the main event did not get even get underway until 2-3 a.m. CDT, as the beginning stages of a developing squall line took shape in far northern portions of South Central Nebraska, evolving from earlier activity that initiated in northern Nebraska. Over the next few hours, this linear complex surged south, wreaking the aforementioned wind damage and eventually assuming the form of a mature bow echo before departing into north central Kansas mainly between 5:30-6:30 a.m. CDT.   Although the severity of this late-night severe event was not well-anticipated, a chance of thunderstorms was in the forecast as the mid-upper levels featured a fairly compact shortwave trough diving out of SD into Nebraska in a north-northwest flow regime. Closer to the surface at 850 millibars, modest south-southwesterly flow resulted in decent low-level moisture convergence into central Nebraska, and at the surface, a weak cold front sagged southward across the state as the night wore on (eventually augmented by storm outflow). Once storms established a surging cold pool, the moisture-rich surface environment proved favorable to fostering severe wind gusts, with dewpoints averaging in the mid-60s to around 70 F.

Scattered single cell thunderstorms began developing around 3 PM CST from central Kansas northeast into southern Nebraska. The formation of numerous cells quickly resulted in a transition to a multicell convective mode by 4 PM CST. This nearly continuous line of storms lifted north into Nebraska by 530 PM CST. As these storms affected north central Kansas, low-end severe hail occurred from southwest to northeast across Rooks, Osborne, and Jewell Counties. The strongest winds were west of this swath. Phillips County was hit particularly hard as measured wind gusts reached 75 mph in Logan and 71 mph at Phillipsburg. In Phillipsburg, large tree branches were snapped off, knocking out power. The roof was also blown off a restaurant. Scattered thunderstorms continue to develop and move into north central Kansas, at times through the evening and overnight hours, and even into Wednesday morning. None of them were severe until a multicell cluster formed over Lincoln County around 530 AM CST. As this cluster lifted north across Mitchell County, between 645 and 745 AM, they produced 1 inch hail. Other scattered storms developed across the rest of north central Kansas, during the morning hours. They weakened and dissipated, forming a large shield of anvil rain that extended into south central Nebraska. As this rain shield began to dissipate, conditions became favorable for a wake low to form. This resulted in a wind gust of 61 mph at Smith Center, at 1015 AM CST. Repeated thunderstorm activity resulted in swaths of 2 to 3 inches of rain. The highest amount was 3.80 inches in Smith Center.

704371,6/14/2017 0:45,53,MG,nan,"In what had been a slower-than-average severe weather season up to this point within South Central Nebraska, this Tuesday evening event ended up being one of the most significant episodes of the 2017 season. Primarily between 6:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, a rash of severe storms consisting of semi-discrete supercells and quasi-linear clusters yielded dozens of large hail and damaging wind reports, including hail to at least tennis ball size in/very near both Grand Island and Hastings. Despite its significance, this was not a tremendously widespread event in terms of areal coverage, as the vast majority of severe weather focused within a relatively narrow, 30-50 mile wide corridor centered roughly through the Red Cloud-Hastings-Grand Island-Aurora-Osceola areas.   Severe reports were split fairly evenly between hail and damaging winds. Hail was the bigger issue in western portions of the affected areas, with wind damage more of a factor farther east. Focusing first on hail, one of the biggest stories involved both the Grand Island and Hastings areas getting pelted within the same hour. In Grand Island, much of the city saw stones ranging from quarter to tennis ball size. In Hastings, the majority of the city itself observed quarter to golf ball size hail. However, a corridor running from just a few miles southwest-through-west of the city limits endured larger hail up to baseball size. As for damaging winds, the overall-worst impacts focused within counties east of Highway 281. In west-central Polk County, a personal weather station clocked an unofficial gust of 92 MPH, with gusts of at least 70 MPH also reported in the Clay Center, Bradshaw and Guide Rock areas. Many other locations had estimated or measured gusts in the 58-65 MPH range. Needless to say, there was a considerable amount of mainly minor tree and structural damage, including within the communities of Osceola, Shelby and Hordville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported, although storm chasers witnessed gustnado activity along the leading edge of surging outflow. Rainfall-wise, most places received no more than 1-2 from the evening of the 13th into the early morning of the 14th. However, the primary higher exception focused within southeastern Franklin and southwestern Webster counties, where a localized maximum of 3-4 fell in the Inavale and Riverton areas.   Breaking down timing, the first severe storms of the evening erupted along a fairly narrow, southwest-northeast corridor between 6:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, during which time both Grand Island and Hastings were hit with the large hail. Over the following hour, damaging winds became the main issue as outflow surged east, especially within Polk, Hamilton and York counties. Then, between 8:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, the initial wave of severe storms exited northeast portions of the local area while a second round erupted farther south, mainly impacting Webster, Clay and Nuckolls counties. Although the severe weather threat ended by 11 p.m. CDT, quite a bit of thunderstorm activity redeveloped through the night within various portions of South Central Nebraska.    In the mid-upper levels, this event was driven by a shortwave trough swinging east through the Central Plains, to the southeast of its parent closed low centered over Montana. At the surface, early evening storm initiation clearly focused along a composite stationary front/dryline stretched north-south through central Nebraska, attendant to a surface low pressure center that deepened to 998 millibars during the late afternoon hours. To the east of this dryline, afternoon high temperatures well into the 90s F combined with dewpoints in the upper 50s-mid 60s resulted in mixed-layer CAPE values of at least 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of 0-6 kilometer shear increasing to 40-50 knots as the evening progressed.",40.4089,-98.4551

705910,6/28/2017 2:55,53,MG,nan,"Between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. CDT on this Tuesday evening into early Wednesday morning, a strong-to-severe, linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) tracked west-to-east through most of South Central Nebraska, but with its most intense elements primarily impacting areas near and north of Interstate 80. Sporadic wind damage was the main issue, as although not all places observed severe-criteria winds (many sites only peaked in the 45-55 MPH range), some locations saw stronger gusts measured or estimated to at least 60-70 MPH. However, no community was harder hit than Genoa on the extreme eastern edge of the local area. Shortly after 11:30 p.m. CDT, a microburst with estimated 70-90 MPH winds slammed into town, causing considerable wind damage over several city blocks. This included many downed trees and large branches, along with structural damage to both residences and businesses. A lumberyard lost a portion of the front of its building and a section of roof was lifted off the post office. One home had twigs embedded into its siding. While Genoa sustained the overall-worst damage in South Central Nebraska, a sampling of other wind reports included: trees downed in and near Boelus and measured gusts of 70 MPH at Grand Island airport, 62 MPH near Ravenna and 61 MPH at Lexington airport.     Severe storms initially fired up in western Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours and started tracking east. Between 9-10 p.m. CDT, the leading edge of the maturing, strong-to-severe squall line entered the local area into Dawson County. Over the following few hours, this storm complex accelerated eastward while assuming a generally north-northeast to south-southwest orientation. By 1 a.m. CDT, the severe threat had waned as the squall line departed to the east/weakened, although non-severe activity lingered a few more hours within South Central Nebraska before completely ending for the night.   This was a fairly well-anticipated event, as the Storm Prediction Center upgraded the Day 1 severe threat category to Enhanced Risk (level 3-of-5) during the morning hours. In the mid-upper levels, the pattern was very favorable/typical for summer severe weather, featuring quasi-zonal flow and a respectable, small-scale shortwave trough tracking east across Nebraska over the course of the afternoon and evening. At the surface, low pressure centered over the Dakotas deepened to around 998 millibars by early evening. As a result, southerly breezes across South Central Nebraska averaged 15-25 MPH during the day with higher gusts, allowing a warm front to surge north. By early evening, dewpoints had increased into the mid-60s to low-70s F range ahead of a north-south oriented cold front slowly approaching from the west. As the MCS peaked in intensity over South Central Nebraska, the environment featured mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg and effective deep layer wind shear around 40 knots, with a strong low level jet of 50-60 knots feeding in from the south.",40.78,-99.77

These storms quickly congealed into a multicell cluster and moved southeast toward the Kansas state line. Between 5 and 6 pm, these storms significantly weakened leaving an area of stratiform rain. However, around 630 PM CST, the associated outflow appeared to trigger a new thunderstorm over southeast Frontier County, near the leading edge of the stratiform rain. This storm briefly moved southeast into Furnas County around 640 PM CST, and by 710 PM it dissipated. Severe wind gusts of 61 and 66 mph were measured in the outflow ahead of this storm.

The air mass was unusually mild for early March and it moved northward ahead of a strong cold front that went from western, to eastern Minnesota during the afternoon and early evening hours. Dew points rose into the 50s which is very rare for early March ahead of this cold front. In addition, wind shear was very strong which provided the ample source of severe thunderstorm development and organization.    Once thunderstorms developed, strong to severe storms developed quickly and produced large hail near Redwood Falls. Other severe thunderstorm developed northeast of Redwood Falls, to near Hutchinson, and produced a cluster of severe hail reports from Hutchinson, to Dassel, Cokato, and west of the Twin Cities area. Several other storms developed north of St. Cloud and produced quarter size hail near Rice.   The cluster of strong to severe storms that were west of the Twin Cities, produced one tornadic storm near Zimmerman, and moved northward toward Princeton. A storm team confirmed an EF1 tornado produced the damage west of Zimmerman.  Numerous trees and power lines were blown down in the path of this tornado, including roof damage to several homes.   Another area of severe thunderstorms developed in northern Iowa and moved into south central Minnesota. It produced an EF1 tornado in eastern Faribault County, with a swath of large hail from southeast of Blue Earth, northeast toward Albert Lea, and then to Cannon Falls. Another storm became tornadic near Clarks Grove which also produced an EF1 tornado.

This MCS moved into Middle Tennessee around 230 PM CDT, and additional scattered thunderstorms also developed out ahead of the MCS. Numerous reports of large hail and damaging winds were received with these storms before all of the storms exited the area by early evening.  Due to high amounts of instability in the atmosphere and unusually steep lapse rates aloft, very large hail was reported in several areas. Some of the largest hail was reported in Lewisburg, where hail up to 2 inches in diameter covered the ground and caused significant damage to roofs and vehicles. Golf ball size hail was also reported in Waynesboro (Wayne County), with ping pong ball size hail in Hampshire (Maury County) and Summertown (Lawrence County).  Some of the worst wind damage occurred along a segment of the MCS called a bow echo, which is commonly associated with damaging winds. This bow echo moved from Williamson and Rutherford Counties across Cannon, Coffee, Warren, Van Buren, and Grundy Counties during the late afternoon hours. Based on damage reports, photos, and radar data, winds are estimated to have reached over 90 mph in parts of these counties. Damage included a roof blown off a school in Christiana (Rutherford County); numerous trees and power poles snapped, a tractor trailer blown over onto a car, and structural damage to a few homes in Murfreesboro (Rutherford County); structural damage to homes and barns being destroyed near the Iconium community (Cannon County); numerous trees falling on campers and RVs in Fall Creek Falls State Park (Van Buren County); and numerous trees, power lines, and power poles knocked down in Manchester (Coffee County).",35.7028,-85.8405
687383,3/24/2017 0:08,54,MG,nan,"Severe weather was predominant across the central and western Panhandles. As an upper level worked its way east toward the Four Corners region, this helped to bring in some good mid level moisture. Although the low level moisture was not as pronounced, enough mid level instability and a strong mid level jet allowed did set the stage for discrete supercells. A surface low also formed in SW Kansas which helped to compact surface isobars and increase surface winds which eventually set up a dryline across the far western Panhandle which was the local initiation for these thunderstorms. Meso-analysis of 1000-1500 MLCAPE and DCAPE with 0-6 bulk shear around 50 kts allowed for discrete supercells. In-conjunction with cold mid-level temperatures moving closer to the Panhandles in association with the main upper level low, large hail and gusty winds were the main threat wit these storms.

As this storm continued northeast, numerous other storms developed around it, between North Platte and ONeill. One of these storms briefly became severe, producing one inch hail over Valley County around 7 PM CST. While this was occurring, several thunderstorms over northwest Kansas had combined into a multicell cluster. The leading edge of this cluster reached the southern borders of Furnas and Harlan Counties around 7:45 PM CST. The reflectivity was not as impressive as the storms further north. However, this cluster was producing severe winds. It continued moving northeast across Harlan, Franklin, and Kearney Counties through 9 PM. Thereafter, it dissipated just leaving remnant stratiform rain. This cluster produced severe wind gusts at every weather station it passed, with the highest measured gusts including 72 and 80 mph near Oxford. This cluster apparently generated an outflow boundary that surged northward. Severe outflow winds occurred far removed from it, while it was on-going, and even up to an hour after it dissipated. These winds affected much of Gosper, Phelps, and Buffalo Counties, as well as portions of Dawson, Hall and Hamilton Counties, and they occurred with no lightning, no thunder, and no rain in most locations. Winds gusts between 60 and 74 mph were common, and they lasted a little less than an hour at any individual location. Gusts at the Kearney airport were at least 58 mph from 8:35 through 9:15 PM CST.

693889,5/16/2017 23:58,54,MG,nan,"Thunderstorms produced damaging winds and some low-end severe hail over several counties in south central Nebraska on this Tuesday evening and night. Scattered single cell thunderstorms began developing around 3 PM CST from central Kansas northeast into southern Nebraska. The formation of numerous cells quickly resulted in a transition to a multicell convective mode by 4 PM CST. This nearly continuous line of storms lifted north, crossing much of south central Nebraska between 5 and 8 PM CST. As this occurred, another cluster of multicells over north central Kansas merged and moved northeast, eventually taking on the shape of a bow echo. This line of storms affected areas from Nelson and Hebron up to York between 630 and 730 PM CST. More storms over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas eventually consolidated and crossed south central Nebraska as a small scale bow echo between 10 PM and 130 AM CST. The initial line lifting north produced a fairly large area of severe winds from the state line north to Holdrege and Grand Island. A grain bin was removed from its foundation and deposited on Highway 74 near the town of Roseland, in Adams County. A tractor-trailer was blown over on Interstate 80 as well, just south of Grand Island. The highest gust measured was 67 mph at the Holdrege airport. A brief EF-0 landspout tornado was photographed near the town of Exeter. The eastern portion of this line produced the most hail, with a few reports of 1 inch hail over Fillmore, Nuckolls, and Thayer Counties. The bow echo taking shape from Nelson to York snapped a few power poles in eastern Thayer County. The last line of storms to cross the area produced mostly sub-severe winds of 50 to 55 mph. However, severe winds did occur in a couple locations. The highest measured gust was 64 mph in the town of Norman, in eastern Kearney County. A brief EF-1 tornado also occurred in Clay County, just north of the town of Edgar. It was on the ground for approximately 2 miles, damaging outbuildings, trees, and overturning irrigation pivots. This tornado occurred just after midnight CST. Repeated thunderstorm activity resulted in 1 to 2 inches of rain over much of south central Nebraska.

It was 92 degrees at Fort Smith (Sebastian County), and 90 degrees at De Queen (Sevier County) and Monticello (Drew County). In the southern Plains, CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) values were extreme (over 6000 Joules/kilogram). Unleashing this much energy would result in not only a higher potential of severe weather, but a greater magnitude of what storms could produce (strong tornadoes, giant hail, hurricane force winds, etc).  There was one limiting factor. An inversion (climbing temperatures with height) aloft was not allowing air parcels to realize all of the energy available above the inversion (the parcels were capped). As long as air parcels were suppressed, storms would be less of an issue. In fact, much of the 27th went by with no storms in the state.  The cap did break in places during the evening, especially the northeast. Storms swept from Missouri through areas north and east of Little Rock (Pulaski County), and were responsible for mainly wind damage. Wind gusts reached 60 to more than 70 mph in places.  A tree was blown onto a car at Ash Flat (Sharp County), with trees on houses in Walnut Ridge (Lawrence County), Lepanto (Poinsett County), Marion (Crittenden County), and Whitton (Mississippi County). Another tree fell onto two mobile homes at Crawfordsville (Crittenden County), and an injury resulted. Downed trees blocked Highways 141 and 358 near Walcott (Greene County).

683590,3/24/2017 2:22,56,MG,nan,"High winds, some directly associated with thunderstorms and some not, occurred during the evening hours on this Thursday. Between 4 and 5 PM CST, isolated thunderstorms began developing over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The first strong thunderstorm formed near McCook. This storm moved northeast, crossing Dawson County between 5:30 and 6:15 PM CST where it produced nickel size hail near Cozad. As this storm continued northeast, numerous other storms developed around it, between North Platte and ONeill. One of these storms briefly became severe, producing one inch hail over Valley County around 7 PM CST. While this was occurring, several thunderstorms over northwest Kansas had combined into a multicell cluster. The leading edge of this cluster reached the southern borders of Furnas and Harlan Counties around 7:45 PM CST. The reflectivity was not as impressive as the storms further north. However, this cluster was producing severe winds. It continued moving northeast across Harlan, Franklin, and Kearney Counties through 9 PM. Thereafter, it dissipated just leaving remnant stratiform rain. This cluster produced severe wind gusts at every weather station it passed, with the highest measured gusts including 72 and 80 mph near Oxford. This cluster apparently generated an outflow boundary that surged northward. Severe outflow winds occurred far removed from it, while it was on-going, and even up to an hour after it dissipated. These winds affected much of Gosper, Phelps, and Buffalo Counties, as well as portions of Dawson, Hall and Hamilton Counties, and they occurred with no lightning, no thunder, and no rain in most locations. Winds gusts between 60 and 74 mph were common, and they lasted a little less than an hour at any individual location. Gusts at the Kearney airport were at least 58 mph from 8:35 through 9:15 PM CST. Some tree limbs were snapped off in a few locations. A couple barns were damaged as well. Radar provided no obvious evidence of an outflow boundary, but observations showed a minor wind shift from southeast to south-southwest, along with a rapid pressure increase of 4 to 5 mb.  Deep low pressure (992 mb) was forming over eastern Colorado on this day. The associated warm front lifted north into Nebraska, and all of this thunderstorm activity developed near this front or within the northern fringe of the warm sector. In the upper-levels, the Westerlies were amplified with a deep trough making its way east through the Western U.S., with a ridge over the Mississippi Valley. A closed low was in the process of forming over New Mexico and Colorado. Around the time the thunderstorms developed, temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s, and dewpoints were in the upper 40s and lower 50s. Combined with an elevated mixed layer, this resulted in MLCAPE of 1500 to 2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 50 kts.",40.59,-99.25

690457,4/9/2017 21:49,56,MG,nan,"Mainly between 4:30-8:30 p.m. CDT on this Sunday, a small-scale, but intense severe thunderstorm cluster carved a nearly due west-to-east swath across South Central Nebraska, highlighted by several reports of hail up to around golf ball size and a handful of wind gusts ranging from 60-72 MPH. The vast majority of severe weather concentrated within a narrow, 15 mile wide corridor centered from roughly Elwood-Holdrege-Blue Hill-Fairfield-Milligan.   Initially, when storms first entered far western counties such as Gosper/Furnas/Phelps, they were in the form of a short-but-intense line segment featuring severe winds, highlighted by a measured 72 MPH gust southwest of Elwood. However, a fairly abrupt transition in storm mode occurred over Phelps and southern Kearney counties, as the wind-producing line segment morphed into more of a supercell structure with a large hail threat. In fact, large hail was the only type of severe weather reported along a roughly 100-mile path from near Holdrege eastward to the edge of the local coverage area near Milligan. Golf ball size stones were reported in or very near communities such as Holdrege, Campbell, Bladen, Blue Hill and Fairfield, with one report of 2-inch diameter hail along the Kearney-Franklin County line. In addition, there were several other reports of quarter to ping pong ball size hail along the way.   At first glance, this may have seemed like a sneaky severe weather event, as it unfolded behind/to the west of the primary, synoptic scale dryline and instability axis residing from eastern Kansas into Iowa. Because of this, the environment over South Central Nebraska might have seemed less supportive of severe weather compared to areas farther east, especially given surface dewpoints only in the upper 40s-mid 50s F. Nonetheless, multiple factors supported this post frontal severe potential. In the mid-upper levels, a pair of upper level disturbances were traversing the region, including the primary one which entered western Nebraska during the mid-late afternoon. At the surface, forcing/convergence was enhanced by a secondary cold front surging in from the west off the High Plains. Despite modest-at-best low level moisture, cold air aloft and steep lapse rates (evidenced by 500 millibar temperatures of -16 to -18C) resulted in mixed-layer CAPE up to around 1000 J/kg, which proved plenty sufficient for isolated severe storm development given strong effective wind shear of 40-50 knots.",40.28,-100.17

Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County. Large tree branches were also snapped off in a couple locations. This cluster produced severe outflow winds far from the heaviest precipitation. The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281.

693885,5/16/2017 23:25,56,MG,nan,"Thunderstorms produced damaging winds and some low-end severe hail over several counties in south central Nebraska on this Tuesday evening and night. Scattered single cell thunderstorms began developing around 3 PM CST from central Kansas northeast into southern Nebraska. The formation of numerous cells quickly resulted in a transition to a multicell convective mode by 4 PM CST. This nearly continuous line of storms lifted north, crossing much of south central Nebraska between 5 and 8 PM CST.

The majority of local activity targeted Phillips and northwestern Smith counties, as a mix of semi-discrete cells and quasi-linear clusters roamed and redeveloped over the area between 7-10 p.m. CDT. These storms were mainly hail-producers, yielding stones to the size of golf balls in Agra, ping pong balls north of Kensington and quarter size in and near Phillipsburg and Speed. Prior to any development in those areas, a lone severe storm drifting north out of central Kansas into southern Osborne County dropped quarter size hail in Natoma shortly before 6:30 p.m. CDT before weakening. Although damaging winds did not seem to be much of an issue, a KSU mesonet site near Tipton measured a 64 MPH gust shortly after 10 p.m. CDT as outflow surged north out of central Kansas along the leading edge of a weakening storm cluster. After this, a smattering of weak convection persisted within the local area for several hours before ending completely by 4 a.m. CDT on the 14th. Rainfall-wise, most of this six-county domain received little if any, but portions of mainly northern Phillips and northwestern Smith counties received at least 1, with radar estimation suggesting a small part of extreme northern Smith County might have had 3.   In the mid-upper levels, this event was driven by a shortwave trough swinging east through the Central Plains, to the southeast of its parent closed low centered over Montana.

An upper low was over North Dakota while upper ridging was over northern Mexico.  A shortwave passing over the northern part of the ridge put West Texas in westerly winds aloft and provided some upper level support for thunderstorms.  Good moisture east of the dryline, strong heating at the surface with temperatures in the upper 90s to 100s, and high lapse rates lead to very strong instability.  Those parameters in combination with wind shear attributed to organized thunderstorm development.  These thunderstorms were not supercells, instead they were extremely strong multicellular thunderstorms with tops exceeding 60,000 feet.  These severe storms produced very large hail and damaging winds as they moved across parts of the Permian Basin, impacting the highly populated cities of Midland and Odessa.  Odessa received the largest hail and strongest winds.     The thunderstorms began to weaken as they moved into the City of Midland.

As for hail, the largest reported stones up to ping pong size fell in Cozad and near Johnson Lake, with half dollar size hail reported in Gothenburg and near Holbrook. As for severe winds, a mesonet station near Cambridge measured a peak of 68 MPH and a storm chaser near Arapahoe clocked a 65 MPH gust. Several tree branches were downed in Cambridge, some up to 6-8 inches in diameter. Rainfall-wise, most areas affected by this convection received less than 2, but localized pockets of all three affected counties tallied 3 or more, including 3.72 in Cozad. However, any known flooding impacts were fairly minimal.   Timing-wise, the first severe storms of the night to affect the local area drifted into Dawson County from the north between 9:00-10:30 p.m. CDT, including an embedded supercell in the western half of the county. For the next several hours, this storm expanded into a small-scale severe cluster as it trudged slowly southward through Gosper and Furnas counties, eventually weakening/dissipating near the KS border around 2 a.m. CDT. Meanwhile, another cluster of strong to perhaps marginally severe storms redeveloped over Dawson County between 1:30-3:30 a.m. CDT, but the only ground-truth report consisted of penny size hail at Willow Island. By 3:30 a.m. CDT the severe weather threat had ended, with only weak convection gradually fading thereafter.   Meteorologically, this was a fairly classic case of a weakly forced but moderately unstable late-summer severe storm setup. In the mid-upper levels, flow was from the west-northwest, with a fairly subtle shortwave trough moving into the region. At the surface, a weak cold front was draped through north central and western Nebraska during the afternoon, sparking the initial severe convection of the day. Eventually, these storms propagated southward into the local area around dark, sustained into the night by considerable instability and a modest southwesterly low level jet of 25-30 knots (evident at 850 millibars).

693888,5/16/2017 23:55,58,MG,nan,"Thunderstorms produced damaging winds and some low-end severe hail over several counties in south central Nebraska on this Tuesday evening and night. Scattered single cell thunderstorms began developing around 3 PM CST from central Kansas northeast into southern Nebraska. The formation of numerous cells quickly resulted in a transition to a multicell convective mode by 4 PM CST. This nearly continuous line of storms lifted north, crossing much of south central Nebraska between 5 and 8 PM CST. As this occurred, another cluster of multicells over north central Kansas merged and moved northeast, eventually taking on the shape of a bow echo. This line of storms affected areas from Nelson and Hebron up to York between 630 and 730 PM CST. More storms over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas eventually consolidated and crossed south central Nebraska as a small scale bow echo between 10 PM and 130 AM CST. The initial line lifting north produced a fairly large area of severe winds from the state line north to Holdrege and Grand Island. A grain bin was removed from its foundation and deposited on Highway 74 near the town of Roseland, in Adams County. A tractor-trailer was blown over on Interstate 80 as well, just south of Grand Island. The highest gust measured was 67 mph at the Holdrege airport. A brief EF-0 landspout tornado was photographed near the town of Exeter. The eastern portion of this line produced the most hail, with a few reports of 1 inch hail over Fillmore, Nuckolls, and Thayer Counties. The bow echo taking shape from Nelson to York snapped a few power poles in eastern Thayer County. The last line of storms to cross the area produced mostly sub-severe winds of 50 to 55 mph. However, severe winds did occur in a couple locations. The highest measured gust was 64 mph in the town of Norman, in eastern Kearney County. A brief EF-1 tornado also occurred in Clay County, just north of the town of Edgar. It was on the ground for approximately 2 miles, damaging outbuildings, trees, and overturning irrigation pivots. This tornado occurred just after midnight CST. Repeated thunderstorm activity resulted in 1 to 2 inches of rain over much of south central Nebraska. There were even a couple reports in excess of 3 inches. Ditches were full of water, and even some minor flooding of low-lying areas occurred near Highway 136 just west of the town of Inavale, and also near the intersections of Highways 81 and 92 west of Osceola.

690467,4/9/2017 22:24,59,MG,nan,"Mainly between 4:30-8:30 p.m. CDT on this Sunday, a small-scale, but intense severe thunderstorm cluster carved a nearly due west-to-east swath across South Central Nebraska, highlighted by several reports of hail up to around golf ball size and a handful of wind gusts ranging from 60-72 MPH. The vast majority of severe weather concentrated within a narrow, 15 mile wide corridor centered from roughly Elwood-Holdrege-Blue Hill-Fairfield-Milligan.   Initially, when storms first entered far western counties such as Gosper/Furnas/Phelps, they were in the form of a short-but-intense line segment featuring severe winds, highlighted by a measured 72 MPH gust southwest of Elwood. However, a fairly abrupt transition in storm mode occurred over Phelps and southern Kearney counties, as the wind-producing line segment morphed into more of a supercell structure with a large hail threat. In fact, large hail was the only type of severe weather reported along a roughly 100-mile path from near Holdrege eastward to the edge of the local coverage area near Milligan. Golf ball size stones were reported in or very near communities such as Holdrege, Campbell, Bladen, Blue Hill and Fairfield, with one report of 2-inch diameter hail along the Kearney-Franklin County line. In addition, there were several other reports of quarter to ping pong ball size hail along the way.   At first glance, this may have seemed like a sneaky severe weather event, as it unfolded behind/to the west of the primary, synoptic scale dryline and instability axis residing from eastern Kansas into Iowa. Because of this, the environment over South Central Nebraska might have seemed less supportive of severe weather compared to areas farther east, especially given surface dewpoints only in the upper 40s-mid 50s F. Nonetheless, multiple factors supported this post frontal severe potential. In the mid-upper levels, a pair of upper level disturbances were traversing the region, including the primary one which entered western Nebraska during the mid-late afternoon. At the surface, forcing/convergence was enhanced by a secondary cold front surging in from the west off the High Plains. Despite modest-at-best low level moisture, cold air aloft and steep lapse rates (evidenced by 500 millibar temperatures of -16 to -18C) resulted in mixed-layer CAPE up to around 1000 J/kg, which proved plenty sufficient for isolated severe storm development given strong effective wind shear of 40-50 knots.",40.6,-99.85

This storm moved northeast, crossing Dawson County between 5:30 and 6:15 PM CST where it produced nickel size hail near Cozad. As this storm continued northeast, numerous other storms developed around it, between North Platte and ONeill. One of these storms briefly became severe, producing one inch hail over Valley County around 7 PM CST. While this was occurring, several thunderstorms over northwest Kansas had combined into a multicell cluster. The leading edge of this cluster reached the southern borders of Furnas and Harlan Counties around 7:45 PM CST. The reflectivity was not as impressive as the storms further north. However, this cluster was producing severe winds. It continued moving northeast across Harlan, Franklin, and Kearney Counties through 9 PM. Thereafter, it dissipated just leaving remnant stratiform rain. This cluster produced severe wind gusts at every weather station it passed, with the highest measured gusts including 72 and 80 mph near Oxford. This cluster apparently generated an outflow boundary that surged northward. Severe outflow winds occurred far removed from it, while it was on-going, and even up to an hour after it dissipated. These winds affected much of Gosper, Phelps, and Buffalo Counties, as well as portions of Dawson, Hall and Hamilton Counties, and they occurred with no lightning, no thunder, and no rain in most locations.

710261,6/14/2017 1:10,60,MG,A personal weather station measured a 69 MPH gust.,"In what had been a slower-than-average severe weather season up to this point within South Central Nebraska, this Tuesday evening event ended up being one of the most significant episodes of the 2017 season. Primarily between 6:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, a rash of severe storms consisting of semi-discrete supercells and quasi-linear clusters yielded dozens of large hail and damaging wind reports, including hail to at least tennis ball size in/very near both Grand Island and Hastings. Despite its significance, this was not a tremendously widespread event in terms of areal coverage, as the vast majority of severe weather focused within a relatively narrow, 30-50 mile wide corridor centered roughly through the Red Cloud-Hastings-Grand Island-Aurora-Osceola areas.   Severe reports were split fairly evenly between hail and damaging winds. Hail was the bigger issue in western portions of the affected areas, with wind damage more of a factor farther east. Focusing first on hail, one of the biggest stories involved both the Grand Island and Hastings areas getting pelted within the same hour. In Grand Island, much of the city saw stones ranging from quarter to tennis ball size. In Hastings, the majority of the city itself observed quarter to golf ball size hail. However, a corridor running from just a few miles southwest-through-west of the city limits endured larger hail up to baseball size. As for damaging winds, the overall-worst impacts focused within counties east of Highway 281. In west-central Polk County, a personal weather station clocked an unofficial gust of 92 MPH, with gusts of at least 70 MPH also reported in the Clay Center, Bradshaw and Guide Rock areas. Many other locations had estimated or measured gusts in the 58-65 MPH range. Needless to say, there was a considerable amount of mainly minor tree and structural damage, including within the communities of Osceola, Shelby and Hordville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported, although storm chasers witnessed gustnado activity along the leading edge of surging outflow. Rainfall-wise, most places received no more than 1-2 from the evening of the 13th into the early morning of the 14th. However, the primary higher exception focused within southeastern Franklin and southwestern Webster counties, where a localized maximum of 3-4 fell in the Inavale and Riverton areas.   Breaking down timing, the first severe storms of the evening erupted along a fairly narrow, southwest-northeast corridor between 6:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, during which time both Grand Island and Hastings were hit with the large hail. Over the following hour, damaging winds became the main issue as outflow surged east, especially within Polk, Hamilton and York counties. Then, between 8:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, the initial wave of severe storms exited northeast portions of the local area while a second round erupted farther south, mainly impacting Webster, Clay and Nuckolls counties. Although the severe weather threat ended by 11 p.m. CDT, quite a bit of thunderstorm activity redeveloped through the night within various portions of South Central Nebraska.    In the mid-upper levels, this event was driven by a shortwave trough swinging east through the Central Plains, to the southeast of its parent closed low centered over Montana. At the surface, early evening storm initiation clearly focused along a composite stationary front/dryline stretched north-south through central Nebraska, attendant to a surface low pressure center that deepened to 998 millibars during the late afternoon hours. To the east of this dryline, afternoon high temperatures well into the 90s F combined with dewpoints in the upper 50s-mid 60s resulted in mixed-layer CAPE values of at least 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of 0-6 kilometer shear increasing to 40-50 knots as the evening progressed.",41.3592,-97.43
703562,6/15/2017 0:41,60,MG,A thunderstorm moved across Martin County and produced a 69 mph wind gust at the mesonet site near Tarzan.,"During the early evening of June 14, 2017 severe thunderstorms developed along a dryline and moved across Odessa and into Midland, Texas. An upper low was over North Dakota while upper ridging was over northern Mexico.  A shortwave passing over the northern part of the ridge put West Texas in westerly winds aloft and provided some upper level support for thunderstorms.  Good moisture east of the dryline, strong heating at the surface with temperatures in the upper 90s to 100s, and high lapse rates lead to very strong instability.  Those parameters in combination with wind shear attributed to organized thunderstorm development.  These thunderstorms were not supercells, instead they were extremely strong multicellular thunderstorms with tops exceeding 60,000 feet.  These severe storms produced very large hail and damaging winds as they moved across parts of the Permian Basin, impacting the highly populated cities of Midland and Odessa.  Odessa received the largest hail and strongest winds.     The thunderstorms began to weaken as they moved into the City of Midland. The storm survey noted damage across a wide area of Odessa and West Odessa. There were reports of power poles snapped. There were numerous reports of baseball size or larger hail and the storm survey found evidence of hail possibly larger than softball size.  Numerous homes and businesses had roof damage, windows broken and exterior siding damaged.  Numerous trees were uprooted by the strong winds and thousands of cars were damaged by the large hail. This was likely caused by a microburst with estimated wind speeds of 100 mph. The damage estimate for the storms this day and on June 12th totaled to $480 million.",32.3111,-102.0016

Sporadic wind damage was the main issue, as although not all places observed severe-criteria winds (many sites only peaked in the 45-55 MPH range), some locations saw stronger gusts measured or estimated to at least 60-70 MPH. However, no community was harder hit than Genoa on the extreme eastern edge of the local area. Shortly after 11:30 p.m. CDT, a microburst with estimated 70-90 MPH winds slammed into town, causing considerable wind damage over several city blocks. This included many downed trees and large branches, along with structural damage to both residences and businesses. A lumberyard lost a portion of the front of its building and a section of roof was lifted off the post office. One home had twigs embedded into its siding. While Genoa sustained the overall-worst damage in South Central Nebraska, a sampling of other wind reports included: trees downed in and near Boelus and measured gusts of 70 MPH at Grand Island airport, 62 MPH near Ravenna and 61 MPH at Lexington airport.     Severe storms initially fired up in western Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours and started tracking east. Between 9-10 p.m. CDT, the leading edge of the maturing, strong-to-severe squall line entered the local area into Dawson County. Over the following few hours, this storm complex accelerated eastward while assuming a generally north-northeast to south-southwest orientation. By 1 a.m. CDT, the severe threat had waned as the squall line departed to the east/weakened, although non-severe activity lingered a few more hours within South Central Nebraska before completely ending for the night.   This was a fairly well-anticipated event, as the Storm Prediction Center upgraded the Day 1 severe threat category to Enhanced Risk (level 3-of-5) during the morning hours. In the mid-upper levels, the pattern was very favorable/typical for summer severe weather, featuring quasi-zonal flow and a respectable, small-scale shortwave trough tracking east across Nebraska over the course of the afternoon and evening. At the surface, low pressure centered over the Dakotas deepened to around 998 millibars by early evening. As a result, southerly breezes across South Central Nebraska averaged 15-25 MPH during the day with higher gusts, allowing a warm front to surge north. By early evening, dewpoints had increased into the mid-60s to low-70s F range ahead of a north-south oriented cold front slowly approaching from the west.

Between 4 and 5 PM CST, isolated thunderstorms began developing over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The first strong thunderstorm formed near McCook. This storm moved northeast, crossing Dawson County between 5:30 and 6:15 PM CST where it produced nickel size hail near Cozad. As this storm continued northeast, numerous other storms developed around it, between North Platte and ONeill. One of these storms briefly became severe, producing one inch hail over Valley County around 7 PM CST. While this was occurring, several thunderstorms over northwest Kansas had combined into a multicell cluster. The leading edge of this cluster reached the southern borders of Furnas and Harlan Counties around 7:45 PM CST. The reflectivity was not as impressive as the storms further north. However, this cluster was producing severe winds. It continued moving northeast across Harlan, Franklin, and Kearney Counties through 9 PM. Thereafter, it dissipated just leaving remnant stratiform rain. This cluster produced severe wind gusts at every weather station it passed, with the highest measured gusts including 72 and 80 mph near Oxford. This cluster apparently generated an outflow boundary that surged northward. Severe outflow winds occurred far removed from it, while it was on-going, and even up to an hour after it dissipated. These winds affected much of Gosper, Phelps, and Buffalo Counties, as well as portions of Dawson, Hall and Hamilton Counties, and they occurred with no lightning, no thunder, and no rain in most locations. Winds gusts between 60 and 74 mph were common, and they lasted a little less than an hour at any individual location. Gusts at the Kearney airport were at least 58 mph from 8:35 through 9:15 PM CST. Some tree limbs were snapped off in a few locations. A couple barns were damaged as well.

A broken line of thunderstorms developed from northwest to southeast across the state of Nebraska during late in the afternoon hours. In the portion affecting central and south central portions of the state, a couple storms over the eastern portion of this line briefly turned severe, producing hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter in parts of Valley County. This portion of the line then dissipated, but storms from Custer County westward continued to increase and organize. By 7 pm CST, a cluster of severe storms had developed over southwest Custer and Lincoln Counties. This cluster became a small-scale squall line and, between 7 and 11 pm CST, it advanced to the south-southeast, affecting parts of Dawson, Gosper, and Furnas Counties before it exited into Kansas. This squall line produced mostly 1 inch hail in several locations. Damaging winds also occurred with the highest measured gust 72 mph at the Cambridge airport.

704382,6/14/2017 1:17,63,MG,A mesonet site located 3 miles west of Bradshaw measured a gust of 72 MPH at 8:17 p.m. CDT and of 73 MPH at 8:22 p.m. CDT.,"In what had been a slower-than-average severe weather season up to this point within South Central Nebraska, this Tuesday evening event ended up being one of the most significant episodes of the 2017 season. Primarily between 6:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, a rash of severe storms consisting of semi-discrete supercells and quasi-linear clusters yielded dozens of large hail and damaging wind reports, including hail to at least tennis ball size in/very near both Grand Island and Hastings. Despite its significance, this was not a tremendously widespread event in terms of areal coverage, as the vast majority of severe weather focused within a relatively narrow, 30-50 mile wide corridor centered roughly through the Red Cloud-Hastings-Grand Island-Aurora-Osceola areas.   Severe reports were split fairly evenly between hail and damaging winds. Hail was the bigger issue in western portions of the affected areas, with wind damage more of a factor farther east. Focusing first on hail, one of the biggest stories involved both the Grand Island and Hastings areas getting pelted within the same hour. In Grand Island, much of the city saw stones ranging from quarter to tennis ball size. In Hastings, the majority of the city itself observed quarter to golf ball size hail. However, a corridor running from just a few miles southwest-through-west of the city limits endured larger hail up to baseball size. As for damaging winds, the overall-worst impacts focused within counties east of Highway 281. In west-central Polk County, a personal weather station clocked an unofficial gust of 92 MPH, with gusts of at least 70 MPH also reported in the Clay Center, Bradshaw and Guide Rock areas. Many other locations had estimated or measured gusts in the 58-65 MPH range. Needless to say, there was a considerable amount of mainly minor tree and structural damage, including within the communities of Osceola, Shelby and Hordville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported, although storm chasers witnessed gustnado activity along the leading edge of surging outflow. Rainfall-wise, most places received no more than 1-2 from the evening of the 13th into the early morning of the 14th. However, the primary higher exception focused within southeastern Franklin and southwestern Webster counties, where a localized maximum of 3-4 fell in the Inavale and Riverton areas.   Breaking down timing, the first severe storms of the evening erupted along a fairly narrow, southwest-northeast corridor between 6:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, during which time both Grand Island and Hastings were hit with the large hail. Over the following hour, damaging winds became the main issue as outflow surged east, especially within Polk, Hamilton and York counties. Then, between 8:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, the initial wave of severe storms exited northeast portions of the local area while a second round erupted farther south, mainly impacting Webster, Clay and Nuckolls counties. Although the severe weather threat ended by 11 p.m. CDT, quite a bit of thunderstorm activity redeveloped through the night within various portions of South Central Nebraska.    In the mid-upper levels, this event was driven by a shortwave trough swinging east through the Central Plains, to the southeast of its parent closed low centered over Montana. At the surface, early evening storm initiation clearly focused along a composite stationary front/dryline stretched north-south through central Nebraska, attendant to a surface low pressure center that deepened to 998 millibars during the late afternoon hours. To the east of this dryline, afternoon high temperatures well into the 90s F combined with dewpoints in the upper 50s-mid 60s resulted in mixed-layer CAPE values of at least 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of 0-6 kilometer shear increasing to 40-50 knots as the evening progressed.",40.88,-97.7874

Between 4 and 5 PM CST, isolated thunderstorms began developing over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The first strong thunderstorm formed near McCook. This storm moved northeast, crossing Dawson County between 5:30 and 6:15 PM CST where it produced nickel size hail near Cozad. As this storm continued northeast, numerous other storms developed around it, between North Platte and ONeill. One of these storms briefly became severe, producing one inch hail over Valley County around 7 PM CST. While this was occurring, several thunderstorms over northwest Kansas had combined into a multicell cluster. The leading edge of this cluster reached the southern borders of Furnas and Harlan Counties around 7:45 PM CST. The reflectivity was not as impressive as the storms further north. However, this cluster was producing severe winds. It continued moving northeast across Harlan, Franklin, and Kearney Counties through 9 PM. Thereafter, it dissipated just leaving remnant stratiform rain. This cluster produced severe wind gusts at every weather station it passed, with the highest measured gusts including 72 and 80 mph near Oxford. This cluster apparently generated an outflow boundary that surged northward. Severe outflow winds occurred far removed from it, while it was on-going, and even up to an hour after it dissipated. These winds affected much of Gosper, Phelps, and Buffalo Counties, as well as portions of Dawson, Hall and Hamilton Counties, and they occurred with no lightning, no thunder, and no rain in most locations. Winds gusts between 60 and 74 mph were common, and they lasted a little less than an hour at any individual location. Gusts at the Kearney airport were at least 58 mph from 8:35 through 9:15 PM CST. Some tree limbs were snapped off in a few locations. A couple barns were damaged as well. Radar provided no obvious evidence of an outflow boundary, but observations showed a minor wind shift from southeast to south-southwest, along with a rapid pressure increase of 4 to 5 mb.  Deep low pressure (992 mb) was forming over eastern Colorado on this day. The associated warm front lifted north into Nebraska, and all of this thunderstorm activity developed near this front or within the northern fringe of the warm sector. In the upper-levels, the Westerlies were amplified with a deep trough making its way east through the Western U.S., with a ridge over the Mississippi Valley. A closed low was in the process of forming over New Mexico and Colorado. Around the time the thunderstorms developed, temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s, and dewpoints were in the upper 40s and lower 50s. Combined with an elevated mixed layer, this resulted in MLCAPE of 1500 to 2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was around 50 kts.",40.2168,-99.5249

690458,4/9/2017 22:13,63,MG,nan,"Mainly between 4:30-8:30 p.m. CDT on this Sunday, a small-scale, but intense severe thunderstorm cluster carved a nearly due west-to-east swath across South Central Nebraska, highlighted by several reports of hail up to around golf ball size and a handful of wind gusts ranging from 60-72 MPH. The vast majority of severe weather concentrated within a narrow, 15 mile wide corridor centered from roughly Elwood-Holdrege-Blue Hill-Fairfield-Milligan.   Initially, when storms first entered far western counties such as Gosper/Furnas/Phelps, they were in the form of a short-but-intense line segment featuring severe winds, highlighted by a measured 72 MPH gust southwest of Elwood. However, a fairly abrupt transition in storm mode occurred over Phelps and southern Kearney counties, as the wind-producing line segment morphed into more of a supercell structure with a large hail threat. In fact, large hail was the only type of severe weather reported along a roughly 100-mile path from near Holdrege eastward to the edge of the local coverage area near Milligan. Golf ball size stones were reported in or very near communities such as Holdrege, Campbell, Bladen, Blue Hill and Fairfield, with one report of 2-inch diameter hail along the Kearney-Franklin County line. In addition, there were several other reports of quarter to ping pong ball size hail along the way.   At first glance, this may have seemed like a sneaky severe weather event, as it unfolded behind/to the west of the primary, synoptic scale dryline and instability axis residing from eastern Kansas into Iowa. Because of this, the environment over South Central Nebraska might have seemed less supportive of severe weather compared to areas farther east, especially given surface dewpoints only in the upper 40s-mid 50s F. Nonetheless, multiple factors supported this post frontal severe potential. In the mid-upper levels, a pair of upper level disturbances were traversing the region, including the primary one which entered western Nebraska during the mid-late afternoon. At the surface, forcing/convergence was enhanced by a secondary cold front surging in from the west off the High Plains. Despite modest-at-best low level moisture, cold air aloft and steep lapse rates (evidenced by 500 millibar temperatures of -16 to -18C) resulted in mixed-layer CAPE up to around 1000 J/kg, which proved plenty sufficient for isolated severe storm development given strong effective wind shear of 40-50 knots.",40.5181,-99.9578

Between 4 and 5 PM CST, isolated thunderstorms began developing over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The first strong thunderstorm formed near McCook. This storm moved northeast, crossing Dawson County between 5:30 and 6:15 PM CST where it produced nickel size hail near Cozad. As this storm continued northeast, numerous other storms developed around it, between North Platte and ONeill. One of these storms briefly became severe, producing one inch hail over Valley County around 7 PM CST. While this was occurring, several thunderstorms over northwest Kansas had combined into a multicell cluster. The leading edge of this cluster reached the southern borders of Furnas and Harlan Counties around 7:45 PM CST. The reflectivity was not as impressive as the storms further north. However, this cluster was producing severe winds. It continued moving northeast across Harlan, Franklin, and Kearney Counties through 9 PM. Thereafter, it dissipated just leaving remnant stratiform rain. This cluster produced severe wind gusts at every weather station it passed, with the highest measured gusts including 72 and 80 mph near Oxford. This cluster apparently generated an outflow boundary that surged northward. Severe outflow winds occurred far removed from it, while it was on-going, and even up to an hour after it dissipated. These winds affected much of Gosper, Phelps, and Buffalo Counties, as well as portions of Dawson, Hall and Hamilton Counties, and they occurred with no lightning, no thunder, and no rain in most locations. Winds gusts between 60 and 74 mph were common, and they lasted a little less than an hour at any individual location. Gusts at the Kearney airport were at least 58 mph from 8:35 through 9:15 PM CST. Some tree limbs were snapped off in a few locations. A couple barns were damaged as well. Radar provided no obvious evidence of an outflow boundary, but observations showed a minor wind shift from southeast to south-southwest, along with a rapid pressure increase of 4 to 5 mb.  Deep low pressure (992 mb) was forming over eastern Colorado on this day. The associated warm front lifted north into Nebraska, and all of this thunderstorm activity developed near this front or within the northern fringe of the warm sector. In the upper-levels, the Westerlies were amplified with a deep trough making its way east through the Western U.S., with a ridge over the Mississippi Valley. A closed low was in the process of forming over New Mexico and Colorado. Around the time the thunderstorms developed, temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s, and dewpoints were in the upper 40s and lower 50s.

Along this path, multiple stations measured winds of at least 58 mph, with the highest being 64 mph near the town of Norman, which is in Kearney County. Large tree branches were also snapped off in a couple locations. This cluster produced severe outflow winds far from the heaviest precipitation. The 64 mph gust measured at Pleasanton was 25 miles north of the storms and this occurred with significant blowing dust over portions of Buffalo County. A gustnado was also reported just south of Hastings, much closer to the most intense part of the storms. This cluster rapidly weakened once it moved east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, the second cluster moved into Furnas County just after 7 pm CST, and it followed an almost identical track to the first. This cluster did not produce nearly as much severe weather. Grand Island experienced severe wind gusts from both clusters - 58 mph with the first, and 74 mph with the second. These gusts were separated by 90 minutes.  These storms initially formed just south of a quasi-stationary front that extended from near Imperial to Omaha.

The formation of numerous cells quickly resulted in a transition to a multicell convective mode by 4 PM CST. This nearly continuous line of storms lifted north into Nebraska by 530 PM CST. As these storms affected north central Kansas, low-end severe hail occurred from southwest to northeast across Rooks, Osborne, and Jewell Counties. The strongest winds were west of this swath. Phillips County was hit particularly hard as measured wind gusts reached 75 mph in Logan and 71 mph at Phillipsburg. In Phillipsburg, large tree branches were snapped off, knocking out power.

One of these storms evolved into a slow moving supercell that persisted for almost nine hours and produced at least seven known tornadoes, including an exceptionally large EF-3 tornado near Dimmitt (Castro County) that damaged some homes and destroyed several structures. It is possible that satellite tornadoes accompanied the larger tornado at times, but no definitive evidence to this point was available. After remaining in Castro County for nearly four hours and producing flash flooding north and northwest of Dimmitt, the supercell storm finally accelerated southeast before dissipating over Motley County around 0100 CST on the 15th.

Between 4 and 5 PM CST, isolated thunderstorms began developing over southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. The first strong thunderstorm formed near McCook. This storm moved northeast, crossing Dawson County between 5:30 and 6:15 PM CST where it produced nickel size hail near Cozad. As this storm continued northeast, numerous other storms developed around it, between North Platte and ONeill. One of these storms briefly became severe, producing one inch hail over Valley County around 7 PM CST. While this was occurring, several thunderstorms over northwest Kansas had combined into a multicell cluster. The leading edge of this cluster reached the southern borders of Furnas and Harlan Counties around 7:45 PM CST. The reflectivity was not as impressive as the storms further north. However, this cluster was producing severe winds. It continued moving northeast across Harlan, Franklin, and Kearney Counties through 9 PM. Thereafter, it dissipated just leaving remnant stratiform rain. This cluster produced severe wind gusts at every weather station it passed, with the highest measured gusts including 72 and 80 mph near Oxford. This cluster apparently generated an outflow boundary that surged northward. Severe outflow winds occurred far removed from it, while it was on-going, and even up to an hour after it dissipated. These winds affected much of Gosper, Phelps, and Buffalo Counties, as well as portions of Dawson, Hall and Hamilton Counties, and they occurred with no lightning, no thunder, and no rain in most locations. Winds gusts between 60 and 74 mph were common, and they lasted a little less than an hour at any individual location. Gusts at the Kearney airport were at least 58 mph from 8:35 through 9:15 PM CST. Some tree limbs were snapped off in a few locations. A couple barns were damaged as well. Radar provided no obvious evidence of an outflow boundary, but observations showed a minor wind shift from southeast to south-southwest, along with a rapid pressure increase of 4 to 5 mb.  Deep low pressure (992 mb) was forming over eastern Colorado on this day. The associated warm front lifted north into Nebraska, and all of this thunderstorm activity developed near this front or within the northern fringe of the warm sector. In the upper-levels, the Westerlies were amplified with a deep trough making its way east through the Western U.S., with a ridge over the Mississippi Valley. A closed low was in the process of forming over New Mexico and Colorado. Around the time the thunderstorms developed, temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s, and dewpoints were in the upper 40s and lower 50s.

The system continued into West Central Wisconsin where it continued to produce severe wind and hail.  The tornado touched down in Kandiyohi County and mostly hit trees and crops, but it did cause significant damage to a couple of large metal buildings.  There were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines in a swath from the South Dakota border, eastward into the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities. Although there were multiple reports of large hail, and some were measured up to golf ball size, the combination of strong winds and hail, took a toll on property, especially in the Twin Cities metro area. The county of Anoka reported some areas receiving up to two feet of hail which caused several cities to use snow plows. The county of Anoka also reported $650,000 in damage to public property and infrastructure.  Wind speeds were measured in several areas up to 70 knots indicating the severity of the storms as torrential rain and hail accompanied the wind.

Large gustnadoes were reported crossing Highway 39.,"In what had been a slower-than-average severe weather season up to this point within South Central Nebraska, this Tuesday evening event ended up being one of the most significant episodes of the 2017 season. Primarily between 6:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, a rash of severe storms consisting of semi-discrete supercells and quasi-linear clusters yielded dozens of large hail and damaging wind reports, including hail to at least tennis ball size in/very near both Grand Island and Hastings. Despite its significance, this was not a tremendously widespread event in terms of areal coverage, as the vast majority of severe weather focused within a relatively narrow, 30-50 mile wide corridor centered roughly through the Red Cloud-Hastings-Grand Island-Aurora-Osceola areas.   Severe reports were split fairly evenly between hail and damaging winds. Hail was the bigger issue in western portions of the affected areas, with wind damage more of a factor farther east. Focusing first on hail, one of the biggest stories involved both the Grand Island and Hastings areas getting pelted within the same hour. In Grand Island, much of the city saw stones ranging from quarter to tennis ball size. In Hastings, the majority of the city itself observed quarter to golf ball size hail. However, a corridor running from just a few miles southwest-through-west of the city limits endured larger hail up to baseball size. As for damaging winds, the overall-worst impacts focused within counties east of Highway 281. In west-central Polk County, a personal weather station clocked an unofficial gust of 92 MPH, with gusts of at least 70 MPH also reported in the Clay Center, Bradshaw and Guide Rock areas. Many other locations had estimated or measured gusts in the 58-65 MPH range. Needless to say, there was a considerable amount of mainly minor tree and structural damage, including within the communities of Osceola, Shelby and Hordville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported, although storm chasers witnessed gustnado activity along the leading edge of surging outflow. Rainfall-wise, most places received no more than 1-2 from the evening of the 13th into the early morning of the 14th. However, the primary higher exception focused within southeastern Franklin and southwestern Webster counties, where a localized maximum of 3-4 fell in the Inavale and Riverton areas.   Breaking down timing, the first severe storms of the evening erupted along a fairly narrow, southwest-northeast corridor between 6:30-7:30 p.m. CDT, during which time both Grand Island and Hastings were hit with the large hail. Over the following hour, damaging winds became the main issue as outflow surged east, especially within Polk, Hamilton and York counties. Then, between 8:30-10:30 p.m. CDT, the initial wave of severe storms exited northeast portions of the local area while a second round erupted farther south, mainly impacting Webster, Clay and Nuckolls counties. Although the severe weather threat ended by 11 p.m. CDT, quite a bit of thunderstorm activity redeveloped through the night within various portions of South Central Nebraska.    In the mid-upper levels, this event was driven by a shortwave trough swinging east through the Central Plains, to the southeast of its parent closed low centered over Montana. At the surface, early evening storm initiation clearly focused along a composite stationary front/dryline stretched north-south through central Nebraska, attendant to a surface low pressure center that deepened to 998 millibars during the late afternoon hours. To the east of this dryline, afternoon high temperatures well into the 90s F combined with dewpoints in the upper 50s-mid 60s resulted in mixed-layer CAPE values of at least 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of 0-6 kilometer shear increasing to 40-50 knots as the evening progressed.",41.2206,-97.7467
