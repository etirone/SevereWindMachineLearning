This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave."

Very strong deep layer shear was also present. A broken line of convection developed over Lake Erie by midday and advanced east across Western NY with several different line segments and brief strong cores developing. The most impressive line segment moved right across the Buffalo Metro area during the start of the event with a measured 68 mph wind gust at the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport. This line segment continued east-northeast to the western suburbs of Rochester before rapidly weakening. Other brief line segments and elevated cores developed south of Rochester with hail and gusty winds. All the storms rapidly weakened and dissipated as they moved towards central New York, where the boundary layer did not destabilize due to lingering low clouds."

Meanwhile, an intensifying surface low pressure system and associated dry line developed along the Red River of North Texas into Southern Oklahoma during the afternoon hours, which spread east northeast across the Ark-La-Tex during the early morning hours on January 11th. With afternoon temperatures climbing into the mid 70s ahead of this trough, moderate instability developed across the broad warm sector, with very strong wind shear in place as large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough axis across East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana.

Cold air aloft associated with this trough resulted in steep lapse rates such that isolated severe thunderstorms developed over portions of East Texas throughout the morning and afternoon, where instances of large hail were reported. These storms diminished during the late afternoon, but a deepening upper level trough sweeping southeast across Oklahoma and Arkansas reinforced a cold front southeast across the Southern Plains and Ozarks region, where a complex of showers and thunderstorms developed by mid and late afternoon over these areas and quickly progressed southeast into the Four State Region. Despite the showers and thunderstorms that affected the area earlier in the day, instability remained adequate especially over East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, and adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas. As large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough, thus tapping into this unstable air, a squall line progressed southeast through all of the region during the late evening through the early morning hours on April 29th, producing widespread reports of damaging winds and large hail.

A very hot and humid air mass was present ahead of the backdoor cold front, leading to the development of strong to extreme instability over the region. The approaching upper level disturbance allowed for the development of moderate wind shear over the region. Combined with the front, it also acted as a trigger mechanism for convection. Severe thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over eastern PA and southern and central New Jersey. These storms produced strong outflow boundaries which served to initiate additional severe convection. The result was a ring of fire in which outflow steadily propagated outward in all directions.

Thunderstorms initially developed over the western Sandhills in central Nebraska during the late afternoon and early evening hours of July 9th. Two supercells merged northwest of North Platte, which resulted in one, forward moving supercell that transitioned to produce intense winds. 80-90mph winds were noted in the North Platte area, including an 87mph gust measured at the North Platte Airport. This activity continued to produce intense damaging wind as it moved southeastward into western Dawson County around 1am CDT on July 10th.

Also, a semi tractor trailer was overturned on Interstate 80 west of Cozad. Another overturned semi tractor trailer was reported just west of Lexington. No injuries or fatalities were reported. Damage in Lexington was not as intense and limited to mainly tree damage with a measured gust at the Lexington Airport of 59mph, respectively. Thunderstorms continued to weaken as they shifted east, with only sporadic, minor tree damage noted in Kearney around 2am CDT. Thunderstorms dissipated to weak showers by 3am CDT.||Overall, it appears that this thunderstorm activity overachieved it���s meteorological environment, at least thermodynamically. The main instability axis of moderate MLCAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg was located primarily across the western High Plains, with generally less than 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE noted across western portions of the Hastings CWA. Instability quickly decreased with eastern extent, which likely led to the rapid decrease in thunderstorm intensity between Lexington and Kearney. However, what was lacking in the thermodynamic environment was likely compensated for kinematically as deep layer shear was impressive at 50-60 kt owing to significant veering of winds from southeast near to surface to west-northwest in the mid levels."

A power line was knocked down over 3rd Street on the west side of town.","Two rounds of severe weather affected portions of south central Nebraska and north central Kansas the evening of July 10th into the early morning hours of July 11th. For the first round, thunderstorms initially formed near the South Dakota and Nebraska border during the early afternoon hours, then shifted southeast into central Nebraska and eventually the northwest portions of the GID CWA during the late afternoon and early evening. Most of the severe reports were associated with an intense supercell on the southwestern flank of a line of thunderstorms. This supercell tracked from just south of Valentine to Broken Bow before it entered the local area in Buffalo and Sherman Counties around 5:30PM CDT. Multiple reports of 50-60mph wind gusts were received, along with 5 ft tall corn being blown over in northern Buffalo County. This thunderstorm continued southeast and impacted Kearney with 60-70mph winds, including a 61mph gust at the Kearney Airport. Additional severe wind reports, and even some quarter to half dollar size hail, occurred in Kearney County before the system weakened as it neared the state line during the late evening. These thunderstorms were supported by MLCAPE values of 2000-3000 J/kg, steep mid level lapse rates, and very strong effective shear of 50-60kt. ||The next round of thunderstorms brought high winds to central and northern portions of the area between 11PM CDT on the 10th, and 1AM CDT on the 11th. This round of severe weather actually stemmed from thunderstorms that developed well northwest of the area, across southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, during the afternoon hours of July 10th. Weakening had been noted around midnight as the leading edge shifted into the northwest CWA, likely impacted by the remnant cool, drier outflow from the first wave resulting in decreasing surface based instability and increasing inhibition. However, a mesohigh quickly developed over north central Nebraska, which resulted in a rapidly increasing low level pressure gradient force and strong pressure rises. In fact, pressure rises on the order of 8-9mb/2 hr were noted at both Ord and Grand Island ASOSs. The pressure rises allowed strong wind to develop, despite an overall weakening trend within the convection itself. Multiple reports of 55-65mph wind gusts occurred with this second round of activity, impacting areas from Ord to Hastings, including Grand Island, east to the York area. The strong winds resulted in numerous downed tree branches and power lines. The pressure gradient and wind gusts gradually relaxed after 1AM, and any additional gusts remained sub severe.||The next round of thunderstorms brought high winds to central and northern portions of the area between 11PM CDT on the 10th, and 1AM CDT on the 11th.

A portable communications tower located 2 miles north of Waco was damaged.,"Extensive line of thunderstorms brought widespread severe wind to much of south central Nebraska and portions of north central Kansas on this date. This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well. A distinct mesoscale convective vortex, modest deep layer shear of 30-35 knots, and an intensifying southerly low level jet up to 45 knots sustained the severe convection well past sunset. Finally, it's worth noting that an impressive surface pressure rise/fall couplet of at least 3mb/2hr accompanied the QLCS across the CWA between 05Z and 07Z."

Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT.

The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common.

Thunderstorms dissipated to weak showers by 3am CDT.||Overall, it appears that this thunderstorm activity overachieved it���s meteorological environment, at least thermodynamically.

Instability quickly decreased with eastern extent, which likely led to the rapid decrease in thunderstorm intensity between Lexington and Kearney.

By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well. A distinct mesoscale convective vortex, modest deep layer shear of 30-35 knots, and an intensifying southerly low level jet up to 45 knots sustained the severe convection well past sunset.

Fairly typical summertime weather pattern occurred on this day in which scattered thunderstorms developed over the High Plains during the late afternoon, posing a tornado and large hail threat, then organized into a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) as they shifted eastward through the evening into an increasing moist, and unstable environment. As is often the case with QLCS events in this part of the country during this time of year, severe wind gusts were the primary threat. Thunderstorm mergers over extreme southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas promoted the development of a significant pool of cold air which caused a segment of thunderstorms, within the broader line of thunderstorms, to quickly accelerate eastward into western portions of the County Warning Area (CWA) between 7-8pm CDT. By the time this activity arrived it already had a history of producing widespread 60-70mph wind gusts, and even isolated 70-80+mph wind gusts in the vicinity of Hill City, Kansas. The bowing line of thunderstorms continued to produce a swath of severe winds as it moved through the southern half (or so) of the CWA through the late evening hours. For south central Nebraska, severe reports were confined to areas mainly along and south of Highway 6 in Furnas and Harlan Counties, though a Cooperative Observer in Gosper County estimated up to 70mph wind gusts. Damage to trees and power lines were the main impacts of the severe wind. The strongest thunderstorm cores, on the leading edge of the QLCS, exited the area to the southeast by around midnight. Trailing stratiform rain lingered for a couple more hours.||As mentioned above, the meteorological conditions were quite typical for this area for early July. A warm and moist air mass and steep mid level lapse rates supported very strong instability (MLCAPE 4000-5000 J/kg) across a large portion of the Central Plains. A broad upper level ridge axis was in place from the southern Plains into the Upper Mississippi River Valley, resulting in weak southwesterly flow aloft. Because of the upper ridging, deep layer wind shear was weak at less than 30 knots, with much of the shear owing to veering of wind direction in the low to mid levels. This indicates that primarily mesoscale features such as an MCV and a strong cold pool were the main factors that supported severe wind in this event, and not synoptic scale features.

This event will likely go down as the most widespread severe weather event of the spring and summer of 2020 for the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA). Thunderstorms developed along a cold front across north central Nebraska, and also within a zone of low level upslope flow over western Nebraska and northeast Colorado, during the early evening hours of July 8th. Both areas of development initially contained both line segments and embedded supercells, posing risks for all severe hazards, but quickly organized into two separate lines of convection, or quasi linear convective systems (QLCSs). By 9pm CDT, one line extended roughly west to east from Thedford, NE to O'Neill, NE and was moving southeast, while the other line extended roughly north to south from near Thedford, NE to just west of McCook, NE and was moving mainly east. Shortly thereafter, both lines began to merge together into one coherent line. Thunderstorms began to enter far northern and western portions of the CWA around 10pm CDT. By this time, thunderstorms already had a history of producing 60 to 75 mph wind gusts and a few instances of large hail just northwest and west of the CWA. The line of thunderstorms strengthened and organized further as they shifted southeast into the CWA between 10-11pm CDT. In fact, an impressive bow echo developed over Gosper and Furnas Counties during this time and raced eastward, affecting areas primarily between Interstate 80 in south central Nebraska and Highway 36 in north central Kansas. Severe wind gusts remained the primary threat. The QLCS had taken on an ���S��� shape by 11pm CDT, slanting southwest to northeast. The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well. A distinct mesoscale convective vortex, modest deep layer shear of 30-35 knots, and an intensifying southerly low level jet up to 45 knots sustained the severe convection well past sunset. Finally, it's worth noting that an impressive surface pressure rise/fall couplet of at least 3mb/2hr accompanied the QLCS across the CWA between 05Z and 07Z."

The greatest concentration of severe wind reports occurred over central and eastern portions of the CWA, roughly from Grand Island and Hastings eastward to York and Hebron, between 11pm CDT on July 8th and 1am CDT on July 9th as forward speed increased dramatically. Several wind gusts were measured between 70-75mph in this area, including a peak wind gust of 75mph in Thayer County. Not surprisingly, widespread wind damage was reported, as well, especially to trees, power lines, and crops. Downed tree limbs (medium to large size) and snapped small trees were fairly common. Power outages were also common across many small towns during the overnight and into the early morning hours, though an exact estimation of peak power outages is unknown. A few buildings also sustained damage, such as blown in doors and roof damage from fallen trees and lost shingles. Finally, a brief EF-0 tornado was determined to have occurred in Merrick County, with peak winds estimated to be around 85mph. Damage was limited. The leading edge of the QLCS, and associated peak wind threat, shifted east and southeast of the CWA by 1AM CDT, though lingering stratiform rain as well as a northwest to southeast band of thunderstorms near the state line continued for a few more hours. The only severe hail reported with this event was along the southwest flank of the QLCS over Furnas County, where thunderstorms continued to regenerate. A few instances of quarter to golf ball size hail was reported.||Meteorologically speaking, this severe wind event was driven largely by a cold front interacting with a strongly unstable airmass due to steep mid level lapse rates, strong heating, and moist boundary layer. Initially cellular activity quickly grew upscale into line segments owing to the linear forcing along the cold front and generally outflow dominated activity, with peak DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg. The primary shortwave trough responsible for the cold front remained well north of the area, near the Montana/Canadian border, but several weak perturbations moving west to east over the cold front likely aided in thunderstorm development as well. A distinct mesoscale convective vortex, modest deep layer shear of 30-35 knots, and an intensifying southerly low level jet up to 45 knots sustained the severe convection well past sunset. Finally, it's worth noting that an impressive surface pressure rise/fall couplet of at least 3mb/2hr accompanied the QLCS across the CWA between 05Z and 07Z."

This was caused by a strong high pressure system over the Desert Southwest that expanded westward into California. This dome of heat brought hot temperatures to the area for several days. Multiple days of triple digit afternoon highs were recorded inland with some coastal locations even reaching the mid 90s. Several days of hot and dry weather further dried fuels over the area increasing fire danger. During this event, a surge of monsoonal and tropical moisture from a former Tropical Storm advected northward with sufficient instability to generate multiple high based and dry thunderstorms that produced several thousand lightning strikes over the Greater Bay Area. Many locations saw wind gusts of 40-50 mph with isolated areas seeing gusts of 60-75 mph. This prompted the San Francisco Bay Area forecast office to issue a rare severe thunderstorm warning. These lightning strikes in combination with gusty and erratic outflow winds sparked hundreds of wildfires across the state of California. Several smaller fires combined to form complexes some of which are now among the largest wildfires in state history. Most of which were still actively burning at the end of August. Hundreds of thousands of acres have been burned with several hundred structures destroyed as well as a handful of deaths and injuries. Tens of thousands of residents were also forced to evacuate. Additionally, all of these wildfires burning simultaneously across the state gave the Bay Area the worst air quality in the world at one point."

This was caused by a strong high pressure system over the Desert Southwest that expanded westward into California. This dome of heat brought hot temperatures to the area for several days. Multiple days of triple digit afternoon highs were recorded inland with some coastal locations even reaching the mid 90s. Several days of hot and dry weather further dried fuels over the area increasing fire danger. During this event, a surge of monsoonal and tropical moisture from a former Tropical Storm advected northward with sufficient instability to generate multiple high based and dry thunderstorms that produced several thousand lightning strikes over the Greater Bay Area. Many locations saw wind gusts of 40-50 mph with isolated areas seeing gusts of 60-75 mph. This prompted the San Francisco Bay Area forecast office to issue a rare severe thunderstorm warning. These lightning strikes in combination with gusty and erratic outflow winds sparked hundreds of wildfires across the state of California. Several smaller fires combined to form complexes some of which are now among the largest wildfires in state history. Most of which were still actively burning at the end of August. Hundreds of thousands of acres have been burned with several hundred structures destroyed as well as a handful of deaths and injuries. Tens of thousands of residents were also forced to evacuate. Additionally, all of these wildfires burning simultaneously across the state gave the Bay Area the worst air quality in the world at one point."

This was caused by a strong high pressure system over the Desert Southwest that expanded westward into California. This dome of heat brought hot temperatures to the area for several days. Multiple days of triple digit afternoon highs were recorded inland with some coastal locations even reaching the mid 90s. Several days of hot and dry weather further dried fuels over the area increasing fire danger. During this event, a surge of monsoonal and tropical moisture from a former Tropical Storm advected northward with sufficient instability to generate multiple high based and dry thunderstorms that produced several thousand lightning strikes over the Greater Bay Area. Many locations saw wind gusts of 40-50 mph with isolated areas seeing gusts of 60-75 mph. This prompted the San Francisco Bay Area forecast office to issue a rare severe thunderstorm warning. These lightning strikes in combination with gusty and erratic outflow winds sparked hundreds of wildfires across the state of California. Several smaller fires combined to form complexes some of which are now among the largest wildfires in state history. Most of which were still actively burning at the end of August. Hundreds of thousands of acres have been burned with several hundred structures destroyed as well as a handful of deaths and injuries. Tens of thousands of residents were also forced to evacuate.

The strongest winds were experienced in central and east-central Iowa where 100+ mph winds were observed. Some of the strongest winds were in an area from roughly Marshalltown, IA eastward along the Highway 30 corridor to the Mississippi River, where estimated winds exceeded 120+ mph and approached 140 mph. A number of QLCS tornadoes were also experienced within the Highway 30 corridor. One of the most remarkable aspects of the derecho was the duration of severe winds, with many areas experiencing at least periodic, if not persistent, severe level (58+ mph) winds over a roughly 30 minute time frame. As the derecho moved eastward out of Iowa, it continued to expand, but weakened from its peak strength. Winds continued to exceed severe criteria (58+ mph) in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan and began to produce additional QLCS tornadoes across northern Illinois before fading out across northern Indiana and southern Michigan.||In the wake of the derecho, damage was substantial in many areas, rural and urban. Many agriculture fields, mainly corn, were flattened within the swaths of strongest winds. Initial estimates suggest at least 850,000 acres of partial or complete crop loss occurred from this event. Within urban and wooded areas extensive tree and structure damage was seen, including complete roof failure in a few instances. At its peak, total estimated customers without power exceeded 1.4 million across the affected states. In total, early estimates on losses (agriculture, infrastructure, private property) have exceeded $7.5 billion across the states affected. ||Environment: Broadly speaking, it was a ripe day for thunderstorms across the affected area with MUCAPE values often exceeding 3500-4000 J/kg by the mid morning hours concurrent with mid-upper level short wave support, and indications that any cold pool development would be strong (difference between cold pool and ambient air) and potentially long lived. For detailed environmental analysis, including soundings, please view the various local NWS office event review pages: NWS Des Moines, NWS Quad Cities, NWS Chicago, NWS Milwaukee, NWS Central Illinois, NWS Northern Indiana, or NWS Indianapolis.||Additional Details: Numerous injuries occurred during the derecho and in the aftermath during cleanup, including 4 direct and indirect deaths of which 3 occurred in Iowa (two in Poweshiek County and one in Linn County) and 1 in Indiana (Fort Wayne).||Disclaimer: The August 10, 2020 derecho resulted in widespread high-end damage across large portions of central and southern Iowa.

The strongest winds were experienced in central and east-central Iowa where 100+ mph winds were observed. Some of the strongest winds were in an area from roughly Marshalltown, IA eastward along the Highway 30 corridor to the Mississippi River, where estimated winds exceeded 120+ mph and approached 140 mph. A number of QLCS tornadoes were also experienced within the Highway 30 corridor. One of the most remarkable aspects of the derecho was the duration of severe winds, with many areas experiencing at least periodic, if not persistent, severe level (58+ mph) winds over a roughly 30 minute time frame. As the derecho moved eastward out of Iowa, it continued to expand, but weakened from its peak strength. Winds continued to exceed severe criteria (58+ mph) in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan and began to produce additional QLCS tornadoes across northern Illinois before fading out across northern Indiana and southern Michigan.||In the wake of the derecho, damage was substantial in many areas, rural and urban. Many agriculture fields, mainly corn, were flattened within the swaths of strongest winds. Initial estimates suggest at least 850,000 acres of partial or complete crop loss occurred from this event. Within urban and wooded areas extensive tree and structure damage was seen, including complete roof failure in a few instances. At its peak, total estimated customers without power exceeded 1.4 million across the affected states. In total, early estimates on losses (agriculture, infrastructure, private property) have exceeded $7.5 billion across the states affected. ||Environment: Broadly speaking, it was a ripe day for thunderstorms across the affected area with MUCAPE values often exceeding 3500-4000 J/kg by the mid morning hours concurrent with mid-upper level short wave support, and indications that any cold pool development would be strong (difference between cold pool and ambient air) and potentially long lived.

Most of the wind damage occurred with the passage of a rare derecho; a large fast-moving complex of thunderstorms with powerful straight-line winds.  In addition, strong wind gusts from 59 to 71 mph not associated with the derecho, occurred prior to and following the passage of this system over the urban corridor and plains of northeast Colorado.||By midday the derecho, which originated over the Great Basin, moved over the northern and central mountains, and then rapidly northeast across the I-25 corridor by mid afternoon.  These storms then tracked across the plains from late afternoon into the early evening hours.  Wind gusts from 60 to 80 mph were common with a few gusts exceeding 90 mph.  The highest gust observed was 110 mph, at the Winter Park Ski area, around 12000 feet.  Xcel Energy said in a press release that more than 208,000 customers lost power because of the storm statewide. The intense wind toppled a billboard that crashed onto Denver bakery.  Two delivery trucks parked nearby were heavily damaged.  Two injuries occurred in Denver, one seriously.

A 30-40 mile wide swath of steady light rain preceded the surface feature. While there were no visible convective elements within the swath of rain, there was embedded convection just prior to the rain moving through, and there was impressive elevated instability present. The rain temporarily stabilized the air mass to the point where the stronger winds from aloft could not mix to the surface, but as the rain tapered off, winds quickly ramped up with gusts of 40-50 mph. Initial wind gusts over Niagara County were as expected, however just as the rain ended further to the south and east, gusts of 55-60 mph were experienced with damage. The convectively-enhanced winds brought down some trees and caused power outages, mainly across the Genesee Valley and especially the Southern Tier. The radar did show a wavy line of showers moving through the Genesee valley at the time of the highest winds, with the damaging winds coming immediately in the wake of the steady rain across the Southern Tier. This was likely convectively-enhanced wind damage given its proximity to the wavy line of showers and also because winds quickly dropped back to gusts of 30-35 mph."

As it drifted southward into Mitchell County between 8-9 p.m. CDT it started merging with a much smaller, separate storm that had flared up over central Osborne County. Finally, between 9-10 p.m. CDT, the now-merged supercell cluster continued southward while exiting the local area into central Kansas, ending all local storms for the night. This was actually a fairly conditional severe weather setup for North Central Kansas, with various pros and cons for/against robust activity. In the mid-upper levels, the local area resided a fair distance south of a vigorous shortwave trough swinging across the Dakotas towards northern MN, resulting in fairly limited forcing aloft. Also working against convection (especially widespread severe) was a plume of warm mid level temperatures, with 700 millibar values of 12-14C promoting a healthy cap. On the other hand, low-level forcing was seasonably-strong, as a well-defined cold front slid southeastward into the area during the evening. Ahead of this boundary, a significantly-unstable airmass awaited, featuring temperatures in the upper 80s-low 90s F/dewpoints upper 60s-mid 70s F, yielding impressive mixed-layer CAPE up to around 4500 J/kg. This extreme instability, in the presence of sufficient deep-layer wind shear around 35 knots, clearly fostered a mesoscale environment capable of stout convection."

This front entered western portions of the Hastings NWS county warning area (CWA) around 7pm CDT. The cold front already had a history of producing severe caliber, non-thunderstorm, straight line winds over western and central Nebraska, and this trend continued along and just behind the cold front as it marched through south central Nebraska. The strongest winds, initially, were focused roughly along an area from Furnas County northeast into Buffalo County, where measured and estimated wind gusts of 55-65 mph were fairly common. Damage reports from these areas were fairly typical for winds of this magnitude and mainly limited to tree and power line damage. By 7:30pm CDT, an area of showers and thunderstorms developed along and just behind the cold front over Kearney and Franklin Counties as the cold front continued to progress east. This activity reached roughly the Highway 281 corridor from Grand Island to Hastings around 8pm CDT. Wind gusts associated with the passage of the cold front had weakened slightly by this time, but were still quite strong around 50-55 mph, with mainly minor tree damage and power outages reported in the Tri Cities. After 8pm CDT, the area of thunderstorms began to expand northeast and connected up with existing thunderstorms that had already developed along the cold front over northeast and east central Nebraska, essentially filling in a gap that had existed in between the two thunderstorm clusters. Thunderstorm intensity increased just east of Hastings between 8pm CDT and 8:30pm CDT, such that the wind gusts produced by the thunderstorms exacerbated the already-high ambient synoptically driven non-thunderstorm wind gusts associated with the cold front. This resulted in the strongest wind gusts of the evening, generally 60 to 70mph, in a swath that covered portions of Clay, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Significant tree damage occurred in these areas, along with damage to a few empty grain bins. Another significant impact, albeit somewhat less obvious or common than typical tree/power line damage, was blowing dust and corn stalks (this event occurred during the harvest season) that led to reduced visibility and ultimately contributed to a four-vehicle accident along Highway 81 just north of Bruning. Another incidence of poor visibility caused a vehicle to leave the roadway in Clay County. ||The highest wind gust with this event was 71 mph, measured by a mesonet station in Thayer County. As mentioned above, the damaging wind events in the eastern half of the CWA were largely driven by convective winds that enhanced already-high ambient winds. Farther west, the severe wind was non-convective and driven by intense pressure rises behind the cold front on the order of 3-5 mb/2 hrs. Overall, this event was one of the more significant wind events of the season and was somewhat unique due to the narrow overlap, spatially and temporally, of both convective and non-convective damaging winds."

But for the majority of the area this was just a classic, stormy early-summer night (most places measured between 0.50-2.00 inches of rain). As for the handful of severe weather reports, the main issue was a brief burst of intense winds through Rooks County around 2 a.m. CDT, including measured unofficial gusts of 68 MPH north-northeast of Codell, 62 MPH in Stockton and 61 MPH at Plainville (no known damage reports). Hail-wise, the only report featured quarter size stones east of Phillipsburg shortly after 11 p.m. CDT.

The first round (mainly 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. CDT) featured generally isolated to scattered coverage, as storms developed directly overhead in response to the onset of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars). Then, primarily 2-4 a.m. CDT the next round charged in from the west in the form of a fairly compact linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that had gotten its act together well before midnight along the KS/CO border. By 4 a.m. CDT, storm intensity had waned considerably across local counties, although mainly stratiform lighter rain held on through around sunrise. This was a fairly typical setup for active nocturnal storms in the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, broad zonal flow reigned as a low amplitude wave rode eastward out of CO during the night. Meanwhile at the surface, a nearly stationary front resided directly through the area in east-northeast to west-southwest fashion, as evening dewpoints averaged mid-60s to around 70 F. Though fairly warm mid-level temps/weak capping held storms at bay until after sunset, the onset of the low level jet easily sparked convection given a healthy reservoir of 2000-3000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE, with the main limiting factor to a more robust severe threat being only modest deep-layer wind shear around 30 knots."

This front entered western portions of the Hastings NWS county warning area (CWA) around 7pm CDT. The cold front already had a history of producing severe caliber, non-thunderstorm, straight line winds over western and central Nebraska, and this trend continued along and just behind the cold front as it marched through south central Nebraska. The strongest winds, initially, were focused roughly along an area from Furnas County northeast into Buffalo County, where measured and estimated wind gusts of 55-65 mph were fairly common. Damage reports from these areas were fairly typical for winds of this magnitude and mainly limited to tree and power line damage. By 7:30pm CDT, an area of showers and thunderstorms developed along and just behind the cold front over Kearney and Franklin Counties as the cold front continued to progress east. This activity reached roughly the Highway 281 corridor from Grand Island to Hastings around 8pm CDT. Wind gusts associated with the passage of the cold front had weakened slightly by this time, but were still quite strong around 50-55 mph, with mainly minor tree damage and power outages reported in the Tri Cities. After 8pm CDT, the area of thunderstorms began to expand northeast and connected up with existing thunderstorms that had already developed along the cold front over northeast and east central Nebraska, essentially filling in a gap that had existed in between the two thunderstorm clusters. Thunderstorm intensity increased just east of Hastings between 8pm CDT and 8:30pm CDT, such that the wind gusts produced by the thunderstorms exacerbated the already-high ambient synoptically driven non-thunderstorm wind gusts associated with the cold front. This resulted in the strongest wind gusts of the evening, generally 60 to 70mph, in a swath that covered portions of Clay, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Significant tree damage occurred in these areas, along with damage to a few empty grain bins. Another significant impact, albeit somewhat less obvious or common than typical tree/power line damage, was blowing dust and corn stalks (this event occurred during the harvest season) that led to reduced visibility and ultimately contributed to a four-vehicle accident along Highway 81 just north of Bruning.

Thunderstorms began to develop along the cold front as it moved farther east into Jewell County between 8:30pm and 9pm CDT.

As for what actually happened, a handful of semi-discrete severe storms produced hail to half dollar size at Johnson Lake and nickel size near Sherman Reservoir, along with wind gusts around 60 MPH near Holdrege and Rockville. As for how the day played out, this seemed to be a case where factors such as the presence of early-day convection in/near the area, along with appreciable high level cloud cover much of the day, combined to hamper later-day airmass recovery and thus tempered the magnitude of the potential severe threat (SPC had upgraded most of South Central Nebraska to Enhanced Risk on morning Day 1 outlooks). ||The first sign of potential complications showed its hand early in the day as a few clusters of elevated, non-severe storms flared up between sunrise and late morning, affecting several counties along/east of Highway 281. Meanwhile, an unrelated batch of higher clouds rolled in from the west, prompting a multi-hour period of mostly cloudy skies over South Central Nebraska lasting well into the afternoon. Then, as skies started clearing and airmass recovery began, an extensive batch of strong/severe convection erupted to the south over Kansas, likely disrupting northward moisture advection and further inhibiting late afternoon destabilization. Nonetheless, despite these factors working against a local severe threat, a broken line of semi-discrete severe storms finally initiated around 6 p.m. CDT in northwestern counties, along a northeast-southwest oriented front. However, these storms did not maintain intensity long, weakening within 60-90 minutes. In their wake, one more rogue severe storm flared up around 8:30 p.m. CDT over Phelps/Harlan counties, but also faded fast. Finally, shortly after sunset a briefly-severe storm just west of the local area made a run toward Dawson County, but weakened as it moved in, effectively slamming the door on any further severe threat. Not surprisingly given the forecast expectations, the general synoptic setup appeared rather solid for severe storms. In the mid-upper levels, broad west-northwest flow prevailed over the Central Plains as a series of embedded disturbances rotated around the south side of a large-scale trough/closed low over south central Canada. At the surface, steady southerly breezes prevailed, to the east of a quasi-stationary front draped through western/north central NE. However, surface dewpoints remained fairly modest by late-June severe weather standards, averaging upper 50s-mid 60s F.

The vast majority of this activity was sub-severe, producing only gusty winds as high as 40-50 MPH and brief rainfall. However, one small cell pulsed up just enough to produce a marginally-severe measured gust of 58 MPH near Speed in southwestern Phillips County, shortly before 8 p.m. CDT. Although this fairly low-key line of convection increased in coverage a bit by the time it reached North Central Kansas, its origins could actually be traced back roughly 300 miles to the northwest, to isolated-scattered storms initiating early in the afternoon over southwestern SD and northwestern NE. In the mid-upper levels, a fairly pronounced northwest flow regime ruled the Central Plains, as the region resided within the path of several small-scale disturbances tracking southeastward around the periphery of a larger-scale trough centered over south central Canada. Despite only modest low-level moisture in the wake of a secondary cold front, this convection made the most of steep low-level lapse rates and seasonably-cool mid level temps, with early-evening mesoscale parameters in North Central KS featuring around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 35-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

Focusing first on severe winds, most estimated or measured gusts were in the 50-70 MPH range and associated with primarily tree damage. However a few isolated structural damage reports were more suggestive of at least 75-80 MPH, including: 1) 10 power poles blown down and three grain bins destroyed (along with some overturned irrigation pivots) west of Aurora...2) grain bin damage and overturned pivots north of Minden. Hail was more limited overall, but stones reached golf ball size at Pauline and ping pong ball size in Davenport, while Hastings saw nickel to quarter size hail. Rainfall amounts varied considerably (most of South Central Nebraska had less than one-half inch), but a fairly narrow swath of at least 1.50-2.50 targeted parts of primarily Thayer/Nuckolls/Clay counties, with one unofficial report as high as 3.17 near Belvidere. Flooding was fairly minimal, although one rural road along the Fillmore/Thayer County line still had water running across it around sunrise. ||As for storm mode/evolution, this was a somewhat complex event. The first local convection of the night entered the Furnas County area out of northwest Kansas after 11 p.m. CDT, in the form of a compact linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) on a weakening trend. But then, between midnight-1 a.m. CDT, a broken band of intense, semi-discrete storms erupted out ahead of this MCS along a west-east axis centered from Phelps-Adams-Thayer counties (likely in response to the onset of a healthy low level jet). However, these initially semi-discrete storms (which accounted for all large hail reports) quickly consolidated/grew upscale into a new linear MCS that charged north-northeast across the Highway 6/Interstate 80 corridors between 1-2 a.m. CDT, gradually merging with the initial MCS racing up from the southwest in the process. During the ensuing hour, the two complexes completed a full merger; the northern end weakening as it reached far northeastern counties (such as Nance/Polk), while the southern end remained severe through Fillmore/Thayer counties before departing the local area into southeast Nebraska. This ended any severe threat for the night, although weaker storms and broader showers persisted until around sunrise in some spots. This was a ripe setup for severe nocturnal storms, especially with the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) aimed into the heart of South Central Nebraska after dark, and tapping into a large reservoir of most-unstable CAPE as high as 2000-3000 J/kg. In the mid-upper levels, flow over the region was not overly-strong, but contained various low-amplitude disturbances and was in the process of transitioning more southwesterly in response to a larger-scale trough setting up over the northwestern United States. There were no distinct surface features across the local area, but steady light southeast breezes prior to storm initiation maintained seasonably-high dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70 F. Likely one of the main limiting factors against a more robust severe threat was only modest deep-layer wind shear around 30 knots."

However a few isolated structural damage reports were more suggestive of at least 75-80 MPH, including: 1) 10 power poles blown down and three grain bins destroyed (along with some overturned irrigation pivots) west of Aurora...2) grain bin damage and overturned pivots north of Minden. Hail was more limited overall, but stones reached golf ball size at Pauline and ping pong ball size in Davenport, while Hastings saw nickel to quarter size hail. Rainfall amounts varied considerably (most of South Central Nebraska had less than one-half inch), but a fairly narrow swath of at least 1.50-2.50 targeted parts of primarily Thayer/Nuckolls/Clay counties, with one unofficial report as high as 3.17 near Belvidere. Flooding was fairly minimal, although one rural road along the Fillmore/Thayer County line still had water running across it around sunrise. ||As for storm mode/evolution, this was a somewhat complex event. The first local convection of the night entered the Furnas County area out of northwest Kansas after 11 p.m. CDT, in the form of a compact linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) on a weakening trend. But then, between midnight-1 a.m. CDT, a broken band of intense, semi-discrete storms erupted out ahead of this MCS along a west-east axis centered from Phelps-Adams-Thayer counties (likely in response to the onset of a healthy low level jet). However, these initially semi-discrete storms (which accounted for all large hail reports) quickly consolidated/grew upscale into a new linear MCS that charged north-northeast across the Highway 6/Interstate 80 corridors between 1-2 a.m. CDT, gradually merging with the initial MCS racing up from the southwest in the process. During the ensuing hour, the two complexes completed a full merger; the northern end weakening as it reached far northeastern counties (such as Nance/Polk), while the southern end remained severe through Fillmore/Thayer counties before departing the local area into southeast Nebraska. This ended any severe threat for the night, although weaker storms and broader showers persisted until around sunrise in some spots. This was a ripe setup for severe nocturnal storms, especially with the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) aimed into the heart of South Central Nebraska after dark, and tapping into a large reservoir of most-unstable CAPE as high as 2000-3000 J/kg. In the mid-upper levels, flow over the region was not overly-strong, but contained various low-amplitude disturbances and was in the process of transitioning more southwesterly in response to a larger-scale trough setting up over the northwestern United States. There were no distinct surface features across the local area, but steady light southeast breezes prior to storm initiation maintained seasonably-high dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70 F. Likely one of the main limiting factors against a more robust severe threat was only modest deep-layer wind shear around 30 knots."

As these winds tore into town, they took down several large tree branches (a few entire trees), causing fairly widespread power outages and even partially-crushing an unoccupied car.

The line of thunderstorms continued east southeast, affecting areas east of Highway 281 and north of Highway 6 between 9:45pm and midnight. However, no additional severe reports were received within these areas during this time.||The thunderstorms were supported by strong instability (mixed layer CAPE values of 4500-5500 J/kg) and modest effective shear (25-35kt). Steep mid level lapse rates near 8 C/km and a glancing influence from a progressive shortwave moving from Colorado into Nebraska Panhandle also aided in severe thunderstorm formation, though the position of this upper disturbance  kept the greatest deep layer shear displaced northwest from the cold front and strongest instability. The low level jet remained rather weak, thus the line of thunderstorms decreased in intensity after sunset with the onset of nocturnal cooling."

A hot, moist, and tropical air mass entered the region behind the front for June 10th, resulting in high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s and dew points in the 70s across the region. Heat indices in Northwest Ohio reached the upper 90s during the afternoon of the 10th. A shortwave trough and associated surface cold front entered from the west, allowing for showers and thunderstorms to develop over western Ohio around 3 PM on the 10th in the warm, unstable air mass. Storms began as discrete or clustered cells over western Ohio before congealing into a squall line. This squall line propagated from west to east across northern Ohio but individual cell motion was from south-southwest to north-northeast as the line moved through northern Ohio on the evening of the 10th. The main threat from severe thunderstorms were damaging winds with the strongest winds occurring in Northwest Ohio. Storms produced wind gusts up to 80 mph in the Lake Erie Islands and adjacent mainland areas of Ottawa and Erie Counties in Ohio, with wind damage across Oak Harbor, Catawba Island, Port Clinton, Marblehead, South Bass Island, and Sandusky. Another powerful segment of the line moved across Marion County, including the city of Marion, prompting sporadic damage in the city with wind gusts up to 80 mph. There was one injury with this event in Marion as a facade of a building collapsed onto a nearby vehicle. The intensity of the squall line waned as it passed east of Interstate 71, though it remained severe with sporadic wind damage. As the squall line moved east of Interstate 77 after dark, the line intensified as the storms caught up to the outflow, and backed winds ahead of the line rejuvenated the thunderstorms. Some strong storms moved across Trumbull and Mahoning Counties, producing additional wind damage before moving into Pennsylvania."
