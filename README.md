# SevereWindMachineLearning
Machine learning approach to predict the probability that a severe wind report was caused by severe intensity wind (greater than or equal to 50 knots)

Data contain the quality controlled training and test data used in the machine learning models

Working codes to quality control the data, train the machine learning models, and make predictions are in progress and will be published upon completion
