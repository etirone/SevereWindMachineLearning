# Notes for this text_file script

### Plan for when I get back from the conference. 

* Jan 9, 2024

The plan will be to flesh out the rest of these python scripts.  I believe that they will all likely succeed using the radar.sif container.  Worst case scenario is I will need to add one more  python library or two to the radar.sif container. 

Once I have that completed, I will look at the R container again for step 4. 

Each of the scripts will need to be updated to be allowed specific dates to ensure it is running properly. 

* Jan 25, 2024

Working on changing the code to work with specific dates like the rest of the earlier code.

**Todo**
* change yesterday code
* remove hard links and add variables
* create README with instructions on how to use.
