# Running the Radar Script 

* Feb 9, 2024
I did not have time to test this script, I have placed all the files I found the script requires to run and have uploaded them to this repo.  

## Input file 


## Google Drive 

## required files 

I don't know where the day1otlk file comes from but there is an example in this folder.

* 2023_05_25_text_file.csv
* 2023_05_25_sub_severe_reports.csv
* 2023_05_25_SR_timefix.csv
* day1otlk_{t:%Y}{t:%m}{t:%d}_1630_wind.shp 

## Required script modifications

Everything is still very much hardcoded in the script, you will want to modify the script to your needs.

## Command Execution 


```
python3 hwt_interactive_plots.py  230525
```
