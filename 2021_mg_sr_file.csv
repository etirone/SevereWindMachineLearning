As it moved northward, Ida began transitioning to a strong mid-latitude cyclone with pronounced frontal features, but with continued tropical moisture. On a regional level, the remnants of Ida became one of the most severe natural disasters in US history, due to a combination of several tornadoes, some of them strong, as well as catastrophic flooding over a large and densely populated area. The severe weather threat unfolded as the system's developing warm front lifted northward from the Delmarva region into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. South of the warm front, partial clearing and moderate to strong instability developed. Meanwhile, very strong shear and forcing, along with tropical moisture, were present within the warm sector. The result was widespread convection in the form of both supercell and quasi-linear thunderstorms. A number of storms became severe across the region, producing several tornadoes and other instances of wind damage.

A line of thunderstorms blossomed along a stationary front between 6-8PM CDT from southern Gosper County E to Adams County, then NE to Polk County. Once this activity developed, it remained nearly stationary until around 10PM CDT when an upper level disturbance arrived from the W and began to nudge convection to the E and SE. The primary hazard with the initial convection was landspout tornadoes. A total of four landspout tornadoes were observed: one in Kearney County, two in Hamilton County, and one in Polk County. Landspout tornadoes are often very weak and cause little to no damage. These landspouts generally fall into that category, but two of them did cause at least minor damage. Most notable was the landspout that occurred near Hwy 14 just S of Aurora. Not only was it very photogenic, but it also caused damage to a storage building and downed a power line. Other severe reports were limited to severe wind gust in Furnas County, and a large hail report in Kearney County. By late evening and into the overnight, the main threat turned to flash flooding due to the stationary/nearly-stationary nature of the thunderstorms. The heaviest rainfall amounts ranged from 3 to 6 inches and flash flooding was reported in Kearney, Adams, and Hamilton Counties. Impacts ranged from flooded streets, underpasses, and rural roads, to water in some basements in Aurora. Thunderstorms weakened considerably by midnight and lingering rain showers ended by dawn on the morning of the 3rd.||The landspout tornadoes developed within a zone of favorable juxtaposition of steep low level lapse rates, moderate low level instability, weak deep layer shear, and high ambient surface vorticity associated with the stalled surface boundary. Heavy rainfall was supported by aforementioned extremely slow storm motions, as well as seasonably high deep layer moisture."

Initial thunderstorm development for this event occurred well west of the area across NW Kansas and SW Nebraska during the late afternoon hours, in which several supercells developed in the vicinity of a low pressure, warm front, and dry line triple point. This is where the most severe weather, including tornadoes, occurred. Other, generally weaker, thunderstorms developed along a SW to NE line through Dawson County between 5-6PM CDT. Only marginally severe hail was reported there. The primary supercells approached far western portions of Furnas County between 7-8PM CDT, but by this time, they had weakened significantly and were no longer producing severe weather. The original Dawson County activity re-strengthened during the late evening hours, and ended up producing a narrow swath of damaging wind gusts from Phelps County eastward into Adams County.

While the vast majority of this activity was sub-severe, several instances of gusty winds peaking mainly 50-56 MPH transpired under the primary convective cluster as it tracked east-northeast within a 20-30 mile wide corridor roughly centered along a line from Beaver City-Minden-Hastings/Grand Island-Central City. The one known exception to the prevailing sub-severe nature of these winds occurred at Hastings Municipal Airport, where the ASOS clocked a rogue gust of 63 MPH (there were no damage reports). Other slightly sub-severe gusts (all from unofficial mesonet sensors) included: 56 MPH at Hildreth and near Oxford, 55 MPH near Stamford, Odessa and Heartwell; and 54 MPH seven miles west of Macon. ||This was a classic early-spring setup for high-based convection with gusty winds. The 4th was the first truly unseasonably-warm day of the season as temperatures soared into the upper-80s to around 90 degrees (F). Meanwhile, low-level moisture was scant, with late afternoon/early evening dewpoints mainly mid-30s to low 40s F (yielding significant dewpoint depressions of 40-50 F) . In the mid-upper levels, broad and fairly weak zonal flow resided over the Central Plains. However, as a fairly subtle disturbance emerged off the High Plains late in the day, weak convergence near a surface low along western portions of the Nebraska/Kansas border helped ignite convection near the extreme southwestern fringes of South Central Nebraska as early as 3-4 p.m. CDT. Despite the notable dewpoint depressions, very steep low-mid level lapse rates in the hot, well-mixed environment yielded mixed-layer CAPE up to around 500 J/kg, but in the presence of only modest deep-layer wind shear around 25-30 knots. Despite the seemingly-unimpressive instability/shear environment, the very high-based convection (LCL heights around 3 km) had as much as 1000-1500 J/kg downdraft CAPE at its disposal...clearly sufficient for a number of strong (isolated marginally-severe) gusts. Timing-wise, the main cluster tracked through the Furnas/Gosper/Harlan counties area between 4-6 p.m. CDT, reached the Highway 281 corridor between Grand Island and Hastings by around 7 p.m. CDT, and finally started losing its punch in the eastern Merrick/Polk counties area between 8-9 p.m. CDT."
943110,51.0,MG,40.9933,-99.6447,GID,2021-04-06 23:31,2021-04-06 23:31,0.0,,"Despite initial concern for perhaps a more widespread threat, severe storms only impacted a small fraction of South Central Nebraska on this late Tuesday afternoon and evening...mainly just parts of Dawson and Buffalo counties. Ground-truth reports were fairly limited and primarily consisted of hail, including half dollar size stones in Sumner, quarter size about halfway between Sumner and Overton, and nickel size in Lexington. There were also a few marginally-severe wind gusts, including 59 MPH near Eddyville and estimated 60 MPH on the north edge of Kearney, the latter likely caused by an interaction between outflow from nearby storms and gusty north winds along the leading edge of a strong, synoptically-driven cold front. Breaking down event evolution and timing, the first local severe-warned storm of the day fired up over western Dawson County between 5-6 p.m. CDT, quickly becoming undercut by the aforementioned cold front surging in from the northwest. Over the next few hours, another severe storm roamed eastern portions of Dawson County. But already by 8 p.m. CDT the early storms had diminished below severe levels, evolving into a cluster of fairly weak convection (albeit with spotty small hail) that drifted across several counties mainly north of Interstate 80 through mid-late evening. Meanwhile, attempts at robust convective initiation out ahead of the crashing cold front south of Interstate 80/west of Highway 281 largely failed between 6-8 p.m. CDT, yielding only a few showers and weak, brief storms. A bit farther east, a strong storm over north central Kansas tried invading the Nuckolls County area from the south but weakened before doing so. Thus, the vast majority of South Central Nebraska was spared severe convection, as any regional severe activity that developed south of Interstate 80 focused well-south into north central and central Kansas. ||On paper, this was a respectable severe weather setup for South Central Nebraska, but ultimately proved to have too many limiting factors for a more widespread event. In the mid-upper levels, lift was provided by a low-amplitude disturbance ejecting across the Central Plains, but the local area remained a bit displaced/east of the strongest forcing associated with a closed low churning across Colorado. At the surface, an effective triple-point took shape over western portions of South Central Nebraska by late afternoon, although the primary low pressure center (around 994 millibars) focused slightly south within western/central Kansas. In addition, moisture return ahead of the cold front into South Central Nebraska was somewhat-modest, with dewpoints only reaching the mid-upper 50s (F). Furthermore, afternoon high temperatures were held down in the 70s in most of the area thanks to fairly widespread clouds, likely enhancing capping and thus hindering pre-frontal, warm sector initiation. Despite the various limiting factors that ultimately contributed to the sparse coverage of severe storms locally, the late afternoon/early-evening mesoscale environment commanded some respect, featuring a narrow axis of mixed-layer CAPE as high as 1500-2000 J/kg in the presence of 30-50 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

Nearly all of the Kansas portion of the Hastings CWA was in a ���Moderate Risk��� in the SPC Day 1 Convective Outlook. A potent upper level disturbance provided strong deep layer shear, but the early-day convection along Interstate 70 led to decreased surface based instability further north.

Initial thunderstorm development for this event occurred well west of the area across NW Kansas and SW Nebraska during the late afternoon hours, in which several supercells developed in the vicinity of a low pressure, warm front, and dry line triple point. This is where the most severe weather, including tornadoes, occurred. Other, generally weaker, thunderstorms developed along a SW to NE line through Dawson County between 5-6PM CDT. Only marginally severe hail was reported there. The primary supercells approached far western portions of Furnas County between 7-8PM CDT, but by this time, they had weakened significantly and were no longer producing severe weather. The original Dawson County activity re-strengthened during the late evening hours, and ended up producing a narrow swath of damaging wind gusts from Phelps County eastward into Adams County. Wind gusts of 60-70 MPH were reported along with damage to an irrigation pivot. This activity weakened as it approached Hastings shortly after 9PM CDT. Additional thunderstorms developed between 9-10PM CDT in conjunction with an increasing low level jet.

During the next hour these cells started joining into more of a broken line as they shifted southeast, and between 10-11 p.m. CDT they evolved into a legitimate small convective complex within Osborne/Mitchell counties, due in part to merging into the northern fringes of a separate area of convection lifting up out of central Kansas (the marginally-severe gust in southwestern Mitchell County occurred during this time). By midnight CDT the main part of the complex departed east out of Mitchell County, ending any threat of strong to severe storms for the night locally. In the mid-upper levels, this event was forced by a combination of larger-scale lift out ahead of a positively tilted trough axis centered from North Dakota into the Central Rockies, along with more localized lift along the southern fringes of a mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) lifting through central Nebraska.

Despite contemporaneous reports from multiple chasers that a large tornado was in progress, following the viewing of later video and picture evidence, the collection of testimony from other chasers in the area, and the completion of a damage survey that found no damage, it was concluded that no tornado occurred with this supercell and the reports were likely associated with a large and impressive scud cloud seen from a distance. While no tornado occurred, this supercell was a prolific hail producer, with multiple reports of baseball size hail.

Along the way, this system prompted several measured wind gusts mainly in the 55-65 MPH range along with several reports of minor to moderate wind damage, particularly within Phillips/Smith counties along the apex of a bowing segment (which likely featured embedded gusts of 70+ MPH). A sampling of damage reports included: several downed power lines and/or poles in the Logan, Prairie View and Kensington areas; a small shed destroyed and a damaged grain elevator leg in Stuttgart; trees down across Highway 8 in northwestern Smith County. As for measured mesonet peak gusts, a few of the strongest featured: 65 MPH in northeastern Phillips County, 63 MPH in Plainville and 62 MPH at Kirwin Reservoir. Although winds were overall less-intense in eastern portions of the local area, a 61 MPH gust occurred as far east as Beloit. ||This MCS first organized and reached severe levels within northeast Colorado between 5-7 p.m. CDT, with its intense gust front invading the local area into Phillips/Rooks counties between 9:30-10 p.m. CDT. During the next hour the most intense bowing segment departed east-northeastward into far southern Nebraska, but sporadic marginally-severe winds continued marching through the remainder of the local area before departing eastern Jewell/Mitchell counties by midnight CDT. Turning to the meteorology behind this event, this was a fairly classic setup for High Plains MCS development. In the mid-upper levels, broad west-northwesterly flow prevailed over the region, with forcing aided by a low amplitude shortwave trough. At the surface, North Central Kansas resided slightly north of a west-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Kansas, promoting an easterly wind regime. During the early evening, a rather unstable airmass occupied the local area ahead of the approaching convective complex, with dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s (F) fostering mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg.

Turning to the meteorology behind this event, this was a fairly classic setup for High Plains MCS development. In the mid-upper levels, broad west-northwesterly flow prevailed over the region, with forcing aided by a low amplitude shortwave trough. At the surface, North Central Kansas resided slightly north of a west-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Kansas, promoting an easterly wind regime. During the early evening, a rather unstable airmass occupied the local area ahead of the approaching convective complex, with dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s (F) fostering mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg. Although effective bulk shear was not overly-strong (only around 35 knots), the combination of a surging cold pool and the development of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet aided MCS intensification."

All hail reports were actually associated with the first severe storm of the day, an initially-isolated cell that rumbled along the borders between Adams/Hall and Clay/Hamilton counties mainly 4-5 p.m. CDT, dropping stones up to golf ball size in Hansen and Trumbull. During nearly that same time frame, a separate severe-warned storm (unverified) blossomed about 25 miles to the south, advancing from northern Webster into southern Clay County. By 5 p.m. CDT these two storms had merged into a small-scale complex over eastern Clay County, signaling a transition to more of a damaging wind threat as it marched across Fillmore County over the next hour. Along the way, tree damage was reported near Milligan and Exeter, and estimated 70 MPH gusts overturned irrigation pivots near Grafton. By 6:30 p.m. this convection departed Fillmore County to the east, ending this relatively brief/localized round of severe storms within South Central Nebraska.||As for the meteorological background, the local area resided under quasi-zonal flow in the mid-upper levels, well-downstream from an upper low just off the California coast that was ejecting various low-amplitude disturbances east-northeastward into the Central Plains. One of these upper waves arrived on scene into central Nebraska by mid-afternoon, likely sparking rapid convective initiation despite quite a bit of afternoon cloud cover and resultant questions about the degree of available instability. At the surface, these storms initiated slightly to the north-northwest (cool side) of a quasi-stationary front extending northeastward from a weak-but-evident low pressure center over central KS (around 1004 millibars at 21Z). Despite the aforementioned mostly cloudy skies over South Central Nebraska holding afternoon temperatures down in the upper 70-low 80s (F) most places, the combination of plentiful low-level moisture (dewpoints upper 60s/around 70), weak convergence along the surface frontal zone and favorable timing of the incoming mid-level wave proved sufficient for severe storm development. Mid-afternoon mesoscale parameters in the area of concern featured a decent combination of up to 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 40 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

Power lines were blown down across a road on the north side of Logan and forced a temporary road closure.,"Between 930 p.m. and midnight CDT on this Saturday evening, the southern section of a fairly compact, but localized-intense mesoscale convective system (MCS) centered along the Kansas-Nebraska border charged across this six-county North Central Kansas area. Along the way, this system prompted several measured wind gusts mainly in the 55-65 MPH range along with several reports of minor to moderate wind damage, particularly within Phillips/Smith counties along the apex of a bowing segment (which likely featured embedded gusts of 70+ MPH). A sampling of damage reports included: several downed power lines and/or poles in the Logan, Prairie View and Kensington areas; a small shed destroyed and a damaged grain elevator leg in Stuttgart; trees down across Highway 8 in northwestern Smith County. As for measured mesonet peak gusts, a few of the strongest featured: 65 MPH in northeastern Phillips County, 63 MPH in Plainville and 62 MPH at Kirwin Reservoir. Although winds were overall less-intense in eastern portions of the local area, a 61 MPH gust occurred as far east as Beloit. ||This MCS first organized and reached severe levels within northeast Colorado between 5-7 p.m. CDT, with its intense gust front invading the local area into Phillips/Rooks counties between 9:30-10 p.m. CDT. During the next hour the most intense bowing segment departed east-northeastward into far southern Nebraska, but sporadic marginally-severe winds continued marching through the remainder of the local area before departing eastern Jewell/Mitchell counties by midnight CDT. Turning to the meteorology behind this event, this was a fairly classic setup for High Plains MCS development. In the mid-upper levels, broad west-northwesterly flow prevailed over the region, with forcing aided by a low amplitude shortwave trough. At the surface, North Central Kansas resided slightly north of a west-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Kansas, promoting an easterly wind regime. During the early evening, a rather unstable airmass occupied the local area ahead of the approaching convective complex, with dewpoints in the mid-upper 60s (F) fostering mixed-layer CAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg. Although effective bulk shear was not overly-strong (only around 35 knots), the combination of a surging cold pool and the development of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet aided MCS intensification."

A pre-frontal trough and a fast moving upper level disturbance provided some lift, which helped convection develop by mid afternoon. Convection was initially concentrated over northern Pennsylvania and New York, near the better forcing, but propagated southeastward with time. Shear was weak to moderate but sufficient to allow some storm organization into multi-cellular and linear segments. A number of storms became severe, producing damaging winds and some hail.

Meanwhile, a cold front slowly approached by evening, with a pre-frontal surface trough ahead of it. The presence of multiple synoptic and mesoscale boundaries led to a highly complex convective evolution. Several areas and multiple rounds of convection affected the eastern mid-Atlantic over about a 12 hour period from early afternoon on the 17th to a little after midnight on the 18th. With shear falling in the weak to moderate range, convection mainly took the form of multi-cellular and linear clusters, though some semi-discrete supercellular structures were noted at times. A number of storms became severe with damaging wind. A weak tornado was confirmed in Burlington County, NJ in association with a line of thunderstorms in the later evening. Areas of heavy rain and flash flooding also occurred due to the widespread and at times slow moving nature of the convection. Eventually, by later in the night, the approach of the cold front and significant overturning of the atmosphere from the day's convection caused remaining activity to weaken and shift offshore."

A potent mid-level trough was also digging southward through southern Ontario and into the Great Lakes region, and a strong upper level jet streak was present downstream the trough axis, over the interior mid-Atlantic and northern New England. This strong upper level forcing combined with the approaching front and a lingering warm, moist air mass ahead of it caused widespread thunderstorm development on July 1. Storms occurred almost exclusively south of Interstate 78, in the environment of best instability. A number of storms became severe, taking the form of mainly linear and multi-cellular clusters but with some embedded supercellular characteristics. Straight line wind damage was the primary hazard, with a number of reports of downed trees and power outages due to winds. In addition, two confirmed EF-1 tornadoes occurred over southern Delaware. A remnant outflow boundary from earlier storms to the north, combined with sea/bay breezes in the area, likely caused a localized enhancement of low level wind shear and created a corridor of enhanced tornado potential. With the cold front remaining to the west, some storm activity continued into the overnight, but storm coverage and intensity gradually waned with the loss of daytime heating and the overturning of the atmosphere from earlier storms."

Although damage reports were sparse from neighboring counties, measured severe-criteria gusts included 68 MPH at Ord airport and 64 MPH at a mesonet in southwestern Nance County. At least slightly sub-severe winds extended well to the south of the precipitation swath, including airport-measured speeds of 53 MPH at York and 52 MPH in Grand Island.  ||Breaking down event evolution and timing, the MCS origins got underway during the evening of the 23rd as a few semi-discrete severe storms fired up within far north central Nebraska. After sunset, this initial activity started merging outflows and exhibiting increasing upscale/linear growth, eventually accelerating southeastward toward northern local counties. However, this system was a quick-hitter for South Central Nebraska, first rolling into Valley/Greeley counties from the north-northwest between midnight-1 a.m. CDT. Already by around 2 a.m. CDT the main outflow surge had cleared the Polk County area, followed shortly thereafter by the trailing heavy rain core. Although this ended the severe weather threat for the night within the 24-county area, another mainly northwest-southeast oriented complex of elevated storms flared up within several counties along/near the Highway 281 corridor between 2:30-3:30 a.m. CDT, likely resulting from the low level jet impinging upon the trailing cold pool from the initial MCS. This secondary complex, which likely produced pockets of small hail early on, gradually shifted east/weakened over the next few hours, with the last storms of the night finally exiting the local area out of York/Fillmore counties around 6 a.m. CDT. Turning to the meteorology, this was a fairly typical setup for nocturnal MCS activity. In the mid-upper levels Nebraska resided under quasi-zonal flow, positioned along the northern extent of ridging extending north-northeast from west Texas, and well-downstream from an upper low just off the California coast that was ejecting various low-amplitude disturbances east-northeastward toward the Central Plains. At the surface, steady southerly breezes during the day and evening of the 23rd promoted a rapid/impressive increase in low level moisture, as South Central Nebraska dewpoints soared from only the low-mid 50s (F) at sunrise on the 23rd to the low-70s by late evening. As a result, a fairly potent combination of instability/shear awaited the MCS as it entered local northern counties, featuring 3000-4000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots deep-layer shear. Also by the midnight hour, the exit region of a 40+ knot, south-southwesterly low level jet was aimed directly into the heart of South Central Nebraska, enhancing MCS organization and southeastward propagation. It is possible that this storm complex and resultant damaging winds might have tracked deeper into the local area if not for the presence of very warm mid level temperatures (700 millibar temps averaged 14-16 C through the night)."

A warm front which had sagged south into the region on the night of the 16th pushed back to the north on the morning of the 17th. Meanwhile, a cold front slowly approached by evening, with a pre-frontal surface trough ahead of it. The presence of multiple synoptic and mesoscale boundaries led to a highly complex convective evolution. Several areas and multiple rounds of convection affected the eastern mid-Atlantic over about a 12 hour period from early afternoon on the 17th to a little after midnight on the 18th. With shear falling in the weak to moderate range, convection mainly took the form of multi-cellular and linear clusters, though some semi-discrete supercellular structures were noted at times. A number of storms became severe with damaging wind. Areas of heavy rain and flash flooding also occurred due to the widespread and at times slow moving nature of the convection. Eventually, by later in the night, the approach of the cold front and significant overturning of the atmosphere from the day's convection caused remaining activity to weaken and shift offshore."

This event began well west and northwest of the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA), within the Nebraska Panhandle, during the late afternoon and early evening hours as a small cluster of thunderstorms. These thunderstorms became severe at various points during their eastward track across the Nebraska Sandhills through the evening, but it wasn���t until they reached the North Platte and Broken Bow areas around 9PM CDT that they became significantly organized and severe. This activity quickly moved into W and NW portions of the CWA between 9-10PM CDT, with the strongest thunderstorms and associated wind gusts focused across Dawson County. Wind gusts of 65 MPH to nearly 80 MPH were common across the county, which resulted in widespread tree damage and numerous power outages. Activity quickly grew upscale in terms of coverage and intensity as it shifted SE, and by 10 PM CDT, there was a solid line of thunderstorms from Nance County to Buffalo County to northern Gosper County that would prove to become a prolific damaging wind producer over the next couple of hours, including for the three largest cities in the Hastings CWA - Kearney, Grand Island, and Hastings. Wind gusts of 60-80 MPH were either reported or estimated in all of these areas. Not surprisingly, impacts were fairly significant, especially in terms of the overall scope of tree damage and power outages, including snapped power poles and healthy trees that were snapped off near the ground. Some of the trees fell onto homes and vehicles. In Kearney, a roof was partially torn off a movie theater, which also led to extensive water damage due to the torrential rain. Conditions became treacherous along Interstate 80 as the strong wind gusts on the leading edge of the thunderstorms led to overturned semi-trucks, other trailers, and campers, as well as very limited visibility due to blowing dust. As the line of thunderstorms moved east of Highway 281, some localized corridors of particularly intense winds, observed or estimated to be as high as 80-95 MPH, developed across portions of eastern Hall County, southern Hamilton County, and northern Clay County between 10:30-11:30 PM CDT. The most intense wind occurred in a swath from around Central Nebraska Regional Airport, where an 84 MPH gust was measured, southeast towards areas near and south of Aurora, to near Giltner. Damage in these areas included: significant tree and power line damage, snapped power poles, flattened crops, overturned pivots, damaged or destroyed grain bins and outbuildings, and two blown over semi-trucks on Interstate 80. Some tree limbs fell on cars and buildings, and some minor roof and window damage occurred to a few businesses. Perhaps the most impressive damage was downed high-voltage transmission lines approximately 4 miles south of Aurora where they cross Interstate 80. This led to traffic issues in the area for a time. Similar tree, power line, crop, irrigation pivot, and grain bin/outbuilding damage was reported in portions of Clay County. The line of thunderstorms weakened slightly as they shifted E and SE towards the Highway 81 corridor between 11PM and midnight, though gusts of 65-75 MPH were still reported in York, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Most notable damage (other than tree and power line damage) were half dozen overturned pivots, flattened corn, and a tree falling on a car. Severe thunderstorms finally exited south central Nebraska by 1AM on July 10. When all was said and done, a nearly continuous swath of relatively concentrated wind damage 30 to 50 miles wide occurred from near North Platte, NE to areas just E/NE of Hebron, NE. Gov. Ricketts declared disaster declaration for 14 total counties in Nebraska, including Clay, Fillmore, Hall, Hamilton and York counties in our CWA, and it was ultimately approved by President Biden. Preliminary assessment by FEMA estimated over 30 million dollars in damages.||Meteorologically speaking, this complex of thunderstorms was not unexpected, though intensity forecasts were ramped up just hours before the onset. SPC outlooks increased from a ���Slight��� risk in the morning, to an ���Enhanced��� risk for the western half of the CWA in the 3PM CDT update. The ���Enhanced��� risk was expanded to include all of south central Nebraska with the evening update. Strong wind shear (effective shear 50-60kt) was a consistent feature of the forecast, with the primary uncertainty being low level moisture quality and how much instability there would be for storms to work with as they moved off of the High Plains. Ultimately, low level moisture, in particular surface dew points, were much higher than modeled. For example, surface dew points were well into the mid 70s across a large portion of central and south central Nebraska, vs. modeled dew points in the 60s. This discrepancy was likely due to strong evapotranspiration from irrigation and mature crops, as well as weak low level mixing. As such, instability was very strong with MUCAPE of 5000-7000 J/kg, and this continued well into the overnight hours. Downdraft CAPE was also high at around 1000-1300 J/kg. Not surprisingly, the Derecho Composite parameter peaked between 4-6, which was significant."

This event began well west and northwest of the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA), within the Nebraska Panhandle, during the late afternoon and early evening hours as a small cluster of thunderstorms. These thunderstorms became severe at various points during their eastward track across the Nebraska Sandhills through the evening, but it wasn���t until they reached the North Platte and Broken Bow areas around 9PM CDT that they became significantly organized and severe. This activity quickly moved into W and NW portions of the CWA between 9-10PM CDT, with the strongest thunderstorms and associated wind gusts focused across Dawson County. Wind gusts of 65 MPH to nearly 80 MPH were common across the county, which resulted in widespread tree damage and numerous power outages. Activity quickly grew upscale in terms of coverage and intensity as it shifted SE, and by 10 PM CDT, there was a solid line of thunderstorms from Nance County to Buffalo County to northern Gosper County that would prove to become a prolific damaging wind producer over the next couple of hours, including for the three largest cities in the Hastings CWA - Kearney, Grand Island, and Hastings. Wind gusts of 60-80 MPH were either reported or estimated in all of these areas. Not surprisingly, impacts were fairly significant, especially in terms of the overall scope of tree damage and power outages, including snapped power poles and healthy trees that were snapped off near the ground. Some of the trees fell onto homes and vehicles. In Kearney, a roof was partially torn off a movie theater, which also led to extensive water damage due to the torrential rain. Conditions became treacherous along Interstate 80 as the strong wind gusts on the leading edge of the thunderstorms led to overturned semi-trucks, other trailers, and campers, as well as very limited visibility due to blowing dust. As the line of thunderstorms moved east of Highway 281, some localized corridors of particularly intense winds, observed or estimated to be as high as 80-95 MPH, developed across portions of eastern Hall County, southern Hamilton County, and northern Clay County between 10:30-11:30 PM CDT. The most intense wind occurred in a swath from around Central Nebraska Regional Airport, where an 84 MPH gust was measured, southeast towards areas near and south of Aurora, to near Giltner. Damage in these areas included: significant tree and power line damage, snapped power poles, flattened crops, overturned pivots, damaged or destroyed grain bins and outbuildings, and two blown over semi-trucks on Interstate 80. Some tree limbs fell on cars and buildings, and some minor roof and window damage occurred to a few businesses. Perhaps the most impressive damage was downed high-voltage transmission lines approximately 4 miles south of Aurora where they cross Interstate 80. This led to traffic issues in the area for a time. Similar tree, power line, crop, irrigation pivot, and grain bin/outbuilding damage was reported in portions of Clay County. The line of thunderstorms weakened slightly as they shifted E and SE towards the Highway 81 corridor between 11PM and midnight, though gusts of 65-75 MPH were still reported in York, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Most notable damage (other than tree and power line damage) were half dozen overturned pivots, flattened corn, and a tree falling on a car. Severe thunderstorms finally exited south central Nebraska by 1AM on July 10. When all was said and done, a nearly continuous swath of relatively concentrated wind damage 30 to 50 miles wide occurred from near North Platte, NE to areas just E/NE of Hebron, NE. Gov. Ricketts declared disaster declaration for 14 total counties in Nebraska, including Clay, Fillmore, Hall, Hamilton and York counties in our CWA, and it was ultimately approved by President Biden. Preliminary assessment by FEMA estimated over 30 million dollars in damages.||Meteorologically speaking, this complex of thunderstorms was not unexpected, though intensity forecasts were ramped up just hours before the onset. SPC outlooks increased from a ���Slight��� risk in the morning, to an ���Enhanced��� risk for the western half of the CWA in the 3PM CDT update. The ���Enhanced��� risk was expanded to include all of south central Nebraska with the evening update. Strong wind shear (effective shear 50-60kt) was a consistent feature of the forecast, with the primary uncertainty being low level moisture quality and how much instability there would be for storms to work with as they moved off of the High Plains. Ultimately, low level moisture, in particular surface dew points, were much higher than modeled. For example, surface dew points were well into the mid 70s across a large portion of central and south central Nebraska, vs. modeled dew points in the 60s. This discrepancy was likely due to strong evapotranspiration from irrigation and mature crops, as well as weak low level mixing. As such, instability was very strong with MUCAPE of 5000-7000 J/kg, and this continued well into the overnight hours. Downdraft CAPE was also high at around 1000-1300 J/kg.

This event began well west and northwest of the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA), within the Nebraska Panhandle, during the late afternoon and early evening hours as a small cluster of thunderstorms. These thunderstorms became severe at various points during their eastward track across the Nebraska Sandhills through the evening, but it wasn���t until they reached the North Platte and Broken Bow areas around 9PM CDT that they became significantly organized and severe. This activity quickly moved into W and NW portions of the CWA between 9-10PM CDT, with the strongest thunderstorms and associated wind gusts focused across Dawson County. Wind gusts of 65 MPH to nearly 80 MPH were common across the county, which resulted in widespread tree damage and numerous power outages. Activity quickly grew upscale in terms of coverage and intensity as it shifted SE, and by 10 PM CDT, there was a solid line of thunderstorms from Nance County to Buffalo County to northern Gosper County that would prove to become a prolific damaging wind producer over the next couple of hours, including for the three largest cities in the Hastings CWA - Kearney, Grand Island, and Hastings. Wind gusts of 60-80 MPH were either reported or estimated in all of these areas. Not surprisingly, impacts were fairly significant, especially in terms of the overall scope of tree damage and power outages, including snapped power poles and healthy trees that were snapped off near the ground. Some of the trees fell onto homes and vehicles. In Kearney, a roof was partially torn off a movie theater, which also led to extensive water damage due to the torrential rain. Conditions became treacherous along Interstate 80 as the strong wind gusts on the leading edge of the thunderstorms led to overturned semi-trucks, other trailers, and campers, as well as very limited visibility due to blowing dust. As the line of thunderstorms moved east of Highway 281, some localized corridors of particularly intense winds, observed or estimated to be as high as 80-95 MPH, developed across portions of eastern Hall County, southern Hamilton County, and northern Clay County between 10:30-11:30 PM CDT. The most intense wind occurred in a swath from around Central Nebraska Regional Airport, where an 84 MPH gust was measured, southeast towards areas near and south of Aurora, to near Giltner. Damage in these areas included: significant tree and power line damage, snapped power poles, flattened crops, overturned pivots, damaged or destroyed grain bins and outbuildings, and two blown over semi-trucks on Interstate 80. Some tree limbs fell on cars and buildings, and some minor roof and window damage occurred to a few businesses. Perhaps the most impressive damage was downed high-voltage transmission lines approximately 4 miles south of Aurora where they cross Interstate 80. This led to traffic issues in the area for a time. Similar tree, power line, crop, irrigation pivot, and grain bin/outbuilding damage was reported in portions of Clay County. The line of thunderstorms weakened slightly as they shifted E and SE towards the Highway 81 corridor between 11PM and midnight, though gusts of 65-75 MPH were still reported in York, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Most notable damage (other than tree and power line damage) were half dozen overturned pivots, flattened corn, and a tree falling on a car. Severe thunderstorms finally exited south central Nebraska by 1AM on July 10. When all was said and done, a nearly continuous swath of relatively concentrated wind damage 30 to 50 miles wide occurred from near North Platte, NE to areas just E/NE of Hebron, NE. Gov. Ricketts declared disaster declaration for 14 total counties in Nebraska, including Clay, Fillmore, Hall, Hamilton and York counties in our CWA, and it was ultimately approved by President Biden. Preliminary assessment by FEMA estimated over 30 million dollars in damages.||Meteorologically speaking, this complex of thunderstorms was not unexpected, though intensity forecasts were ramped up just hours before the onset. SPC outlooks increased from a ���Slight��� risk in the morning, to an ���Enhanced��� risk for the western half of the CWA in the 3PM CDT update. The ���Enhanced��� risk was expanded to include all of south central Nebraska with the evening update. Strong wind shear (effective shear 50-60kt) was a consistent feature of the forecast, with the primary uncertainty being low level moisture quality and how much instability there would be for storms to work with as they moved off of the High Plains. Ultimately, low level moisture, in particular surface dew points, were much higher than modeled. For example, surface dew points were well into the mid 70s across a large portion of central and south central Nebraska, vs. modeled dew points in the 60s. This discrepancy was likely due to strong evapotranspiration from irrigation and mature crops, as well as weak low level mixing. As such, instability was very strong with MUCAPE of 5000-7000 J/kg, and this continued well into the overnight hours. Downdraft CAPE was also high at around 1000-1300 J/kg. Not surprisingly, the Derecho Composite parameter peaked between 4-6, which was significant."

As such, instability was very strong with MUCAPE of 5000-7000 J/kg, and this continued well into the overnight hours. Downdraft CAPE was also high at around 1000-1300 J/kg.

This event began well west and northwest of the Hastings County Warning Area (CWA), within the Nebraska Panhandle, during the late afternoon and early evening hours as a small cluster of thunderstorms. These thunderstorms became severe at various points during their eastward track across the Nebraska Sandhills through the evening, but it wasn���t until they reached the North Platte and Broken Bow areas around 9PM CDT that they became significantly organized and severe. This activity quickly moved into W and NW portions of the CWA between 9-10PM CDT, with the strongest thunderstorms and associated wind gusts focused across Dawson County. Wind gusts of 65 MPH to nearly 80 MPH were common across the county, which resulted in widespread tree damage and numerous power outages. Activity quickly grew upscale in terms of coverage and intensity as it shifted SE, and by 10 PM CDT, there was a solid line of thunderstorms from Nance County to Buffalo County to northern Gosper County that would prove to become a prolific damaging wind producer over the next couple of hours, including for the three largest cities in the Hastings CWA - Kearney, Grand Island, and Hastings. Wind gusts of 60-80 MPH were either reported or estimated in all of these areas. Not surprisingly, impacts were fairly significant, especially in terms of the overall scope of tree damage and power outages, including snapped power poles and healthy trees that were snapped off near the ground. Some of the trees fell onto homes and vehicles. In Kearney, a roof was partially torn off a movie theater, which also led to extensive water damage due to the torrential rain. Conditions became treacherous along Interstate 80 as the strong wind gusts on the leading edge of the thunderstorms led to overturned semi-trucks, other trailers, and campers, as well as very limited visibility due to blowing dust. As the line of thunderstorms moved east of Highway 281, some localized corridors of particularly intense winds, observed or estimated to be as high as 80-95 MPH, developed across portions of eastern Hall County, southern Hamilton County, and northern Clay County between 10:30-11:30 PM CDT. The most intense wind occurred in a swath from around Central Nebraska Regional Airport, where an 84 MPH gust was measured, southeast towards areas near and south of Aurora, to near Giltner. Damage in these areas included: significant tree and power line damage, snapped power poles, flattened crops, overturned pivots, damaged or destroyed grain bins and outbuildings, and two blown over semi-trucks on Interstate 80. Some tree limbs fell on cars and buildings, and some minor roof and window damage occurred to a few businesses. Perhaps the most impressive damage was downed high-voltage transmission lines approximately 4 miles south of Aurora where they cross Interstate 80. This led to traffic issues in the area for a time. Similar tree, power line, crop, irrigation pivot, and grain bin/outbuilding damage was reported in portions of Clay County. The line of thunderstorms weakened slightly as they shifted E and SE towards the Highway 81 corridor between 11PM and midnight, though gusts of 65-75 MPH were still reported in York, Fillmore, and Thayer Counties. Most notable damage (other than tree and power line damage) were half dozen overturned pivots, flattened corn, and a tree falling on a car. Severe thunderstorms finally exited south central Nebraska by 1AM on July 10. When all was said and done, a nearly continuous swath of relatively concentrated wind damage 30 to 50 miles wide occurred from near North Platte, NE to areas just E/NE of Hebron, NE. Gov. Ricketts declared disaster declaration for 14 total counties in Nebraska, including Clay, Fillmore, Hall, Hamilton and York counties in our CWA, and it was ultimately approved by President Biden. Preliminary assessment by FEMA estimated over 30 million dollars in damages.||Meteorologically speaking, this complex of thunderstorms was not unexpected, though intensity forecasts were ramped up just hours before the onset. SPC outlooks increased from a ���Slight��� risk in the morning, to an ���Enhanced��� risk for the western half of the CWA in the 3PM CDT update. The ���Enhanced��� risk was expanded to include all of south central Nebraska with the evening update. Strong wind shear (effective shear 50-60kt) was a consistent feature of the forecast, with the primary uncertainty being low level moisture quality and how much instability there would be for storms to work with as they moved off of the High Plains. Ultimately, low level moisture, in particular surface dew points, were much higher than modeled. For example, surface dew points were well into the mid 70s across a large portion of central and south central Nebraska, vs. modeled dew points in the 60s.

A very warm layer above the surface kept most of the activity isolated until early evening as thunderstorms developed north of St. Croix Falls to Ladysmith, Wisconsin. These storms continued to build southward, and a few developed over east-central Minnesota near Chisago City before moving into Polk County, Wisconsin. ||During the evening, the storms congealed into a solid line of severe storms as they tracked southward across west central Wisconsin. ||As the storms moved southward, several tight circulations developed, one stronger circulation near New Richmond produced a tornado southeast of town. This tornado damaged about one dozen homes, mostly due to shingles, soffits or siding being torn off. One house, however, had windows blown in and had partial roof damage. It also had a garage that was completely blown apart and destroyed, but the garage had been added on and was not part of the original house itself. Another house had damage to its front porch overhang, which allowed wind to enter the attic and punch a hole through the roof on the backside of the house. At a farm, an old barn collapsed. At another house, part of the roof was blown off a machine shed.||Other storm surveys revealed two areas of significant downburst winds. One was determined that a downburst blew down hundreds of trees along a broad swath from 4 miles SSW of Deer Park, to 9 miles north of Baldwin. The trees were blown down from the north, northeast or east. There was roof damage to one local business. The second area was determined that a downburst hit the west side of Spring Valley. Numerous trees, sheds and power lines were blown down. A school gymnasium roof was damaged and a lot of the debris landed on houses and vehicles. A local resident stated that the severe winds persisted for several minutes.||Outside of these damaged areas, there was minor damage to trees and power lines over Barron, Dunn, Rusk, Chippewa, St. Croix and Pierce counties."

The overall-most-intense portion of this complex generally tracked within 10 miles either side of the Phillips/Rooks, Smith/Osborne and Jewell/Mitchell County lines. Although ground-truth reports were limited in part by the time of day, there were a few severe-criteria wind gusts measured in both Rooks County (including 60 MPH at Rooks County Airport) and also Mitchell County (63 MPH per a mesonet near Beloit). As for hail, the only report consisted of nickel size stones in Beloit, although radar data strongly suggested that larger hail likely fell in spots, particularly along portions of the Phillips/Rooks County line. ||Things got underway within the local area between 12:30-2:00 a.m. CDT as an already severe-warned and initially-isolated storm entered the area from the west and lumbered across northern Rooks/southern Phillips counties (prompting the severe-criteria winds near Stockton). Between 2-4 a.m. CDT this initially slow-moving, cellular convection transitioned to a more linear mode as it picked up speed somewhat through mainly northern Osborne and Mitchell counties before departing stage right into northeast Kansas. In the mid-upper levels, large-scale forcing for this early morning event was a bit nebulous, with North Central Kansas residing under fairly weak quasi-zonal flow, well-south of a potent shortwave trough spinning along the ND-Canada border. In addition, convective inhibition/capping was rather inhospitable to lower-level parcels, as evidenced by 700 millibar temperatures around 14-15 C. However, this somewhat-elevated activity appeared to be mainly driven by modest low-mid level warm air/moisture advection within the exit region of a 30-40 knot southwesterly low level jet emanating out of southwestern Kansas. Around the time that the severe storm first entered Rooks/Phillips counties, the mesoscale environment featured 2000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE but no more than 25-30 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

In this same area, a metal outbuilding was destroyed two miles north of Elwood.","Between 7:00-11:30 p.m. CDT on this Thursday evening, scattered thunderstorms rumbled through much of the western half of South Central Nebraska (mainly affecting counties along and west of the Highway 281 corridor.) Although the majority of this activity was fairly weak (producing no more than gusty winds up to 40-50 MPH and perhaps small hail), there were a pair of confirmed instances of intense microburst winds that caused localized damage. Interestingly, both of these episodes occurred within the same 30-minute span between 10-11 p.m. CDT, but were separated by nearly 80 miles...one in northern Gosper County and the other in central Howard County. Starting with the Gosper County event, this one was a bit sneaky as radar data depicted what appeared to be a fairly benign cluster of weakening convection. However, a localized downburst unfolded between Elwood and Johnson Lake, destroying a metal outbuilding around the same time a nearby mesonet clocked an unofficial gust of 70 MPH. A short time later, a similar microburst event occurred in central Howard County, but this time featuring a more telling radar signature as a small storm briefly intensified before abruptly collapsing. In the process, a small rural area between St. Paul and Farwell suffered damage to trees (a few uprooted), grain bins and an irrigation pivot (nickel size hail also occurred in the area). Around the same time, radar data suggested that another storm over Greeley County might have breached severe levels, but no verifying reports materialized. Elsewhere in the local area, the Ord airport registered a near-severe gust of 54 MPH. ||The first scattered storms of the evening within South Central Nebraska infiltrated several western counties (mainly Dawson/Gosper/Furnas/Phelps) between 7-9 p.m. CDT, an eastward expansion of activity that had earlier initiated over southwest Nebraska/northwest Kansas. Between 9-11 p.m. CDT convection expanded both eastward and northeastward toward the Highway 281 corridor. However, once the last robust storm of the evening departed the local area out of Greeley County by 11:30 p.m. CDT, the remainder of the night featured no more than spotty, weak activity. This was a weakly-forced event in the mid-upper levels, as South Central Nebraska resided under modest west-southwest flow aloft, along the southeastern periphery of a broad trough centered over the Northern Rockies. However, the evening mesoscale environment was nonetheless supportive of severe storms, featuring 1000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-35 knots of effective deep-layer wind shear."

However, by far the most noteworthy round focused between 6-9 p.m. CDT, during which time a burst of strong to severe activity roamed various parts of the local domain. Although ground-truth reports were somewhat limited, several mesonets clocked wind gusts up to around 55 MPH, with one severe-criteria gust of 66 MPH in Jewell. As for hail, although radar data suggested several cores possibly containing severe criteria stones, the only verifying report consisted of quarter size hail on the south side of Smith Center. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing and meteorological background, weak/non-severe convection percolated within North Central Kansas throughout much of the morning into early afternoon, downstream from a seasonably-potent mid level shortwave trough slowly approaching from the WY/CO border area. However, this activity diminished in plenty of time to allow several hours of heating and resultant instability to build, aided by surface temperatures climbing into the mid-90s to around 100 (F) in the presence of dewpoints mainly in the 60s. By 6 p.m. CDT, the resultant mesoscale environment featured a fairly potent combination of 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-35 knots of deep-layer wind shear. Between 6-7 p.m. CDT, the first strong to severe storms of the day rapidly flared up within the area, with initiation mainly focused along a south-southwest to north-northeast oriented surface trough. Over the next few hours, strong to severe convection continued within the area (including the early stages of a linear MCS that mainly affected Jewell/Mitchell counties), but by 9 p.m. CDT the vast majority of local activity had departed the local area either northward into Nebraska or eastward into northeast Kansas. Although a few additional flare-ups of spotty, weak convection occurred several hours later during the pre-dawn hours of the 8th, the aforementioned robust activity during the late afternoon-early evening of the 7th was by far the main event of the period."

Although the majority of this convection was fairly weak, there were a few reports of marginally-severe hail and wind in western Dawson County. This included quarter size hail near Gothenburg with one of the first storms of the event and a mesonet-measured 58 MPH wind gust on the northeast edge of Cozad a few hours later. This severe gust was likely the result of a localized weak heat burst, evidenced by telltale fluctuations in surface temperature/dewpoint, along with unimpressive radar reflectivity signatures indicative of otherwise-weak convection. ||The initial and most-robust activity of the event fired up between 5-7 p.m. CDT over western Dawson County, consisting of a broken line of multicell storms focused along a weak, southwest-northeast oriented cold front (including the storm with the Gothenburg hail). After 7 p.m. CDT this convection steadily weakened as it continued affecting far western/northern counties, but the environment remained supportive of gusty winds/sporadic weak heat bursts (including the 58 MPH gust at Cozad). Per the Cozad mesonet, at 7 p.m. CDT (about 90 minutes prior to the severe gust) the temperature/dewpoint was a rain-cooled 76/66 (F). However, just prior to the marginally-severe gust at 8:30 p.m. conditions had warmed/dried to 85/58 despite the onset of diurnal cooling, suggestive of a modest heat burst. Although there were no further confirmed instances of severe weather within South Central Nebraska after 8:30 p.m. CDT, pockets of weak convection roamed several counties south of Interstate 80 well into the early morning of the 10th, featuring a few measured wind gusts up to around 50 MPH. In the mid-upper levels, forcing for the late afternoon initiation in western Dawson County was rather nebulous, with South Central Nebraska residing under fairly weak quasi-zonal flow, well-southeast of a potent shortwave trough tracking from MT into ND during the afternoon-evening. In addition, convective inhibition/capping was robust, as evidenced by 700 millibar temperatures around 14 C. However, the combination of modest low-level forcing along the weak front and the presence of a hot/deeply mixed airmass featuring steep low-mid level lapse rates proved sufficient to initiate high-based storms with LCL heights around 9-10,000 ft.  Around the time of convective initiation, the mesoscale environment in western Dawson County featured 1000-2000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE but no more than 25-30 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

Within the hardest-hit southern counties (mainly Furnas/Harlan/Franklin) there were several instances of not only severe-criteria wind/hail but also narrow swaths of very heavy rain and localized flash flooding...resulting from the highest official/measured short-fuse rain totals of the 2021 convective season within the 24-county local area. On the hail/wind side of things, a few of the more notable reports (all occurring between 5:30-11:30 p.m. CDT) included: golf ball size hail in rural northwestern Buffalo County; ping pong ball size stones near Wilsonville; several instances of estimated or measured gusts of 60-70 MPH within Furnas/Harlan counties (including a few downed trees in towns such as Alma/Orleans). However, for parts of primarily Furnas, Harlan, Franklin and Webster counties, this event's signature calling card was heavy rain and localized flooding. While the majority of those four counties received modest amounts of no more than 1-2 inches, significant training of storms dumped notably higher totals between 3-7+ in narrow swaths over the course of 6-8 hours. The most significant of these heavy rain bullseyes focused along/near the Highway 136 corridor between Orleans and Oxford, where 5-7+ was common, including an unofficial automated sensor that tallied 7.13 and nearby CoCoRaHS reports of 6.22 and 6.16. Although ground-truth reports of impactful flooding/flash flooding were sparse, a resident six miles north-northwest of Orleans confirmed that School Creek spilled out of its banks overnight, inundating a nearby gravel road for several hours and encroaching within 50 feet of his home. Despite this concentrated batch of very heavy rain falling directly onto the Republican River basin, there was no firm evidence that the Republican itself flooded before excess water flushed out into Harlan County Lake. Outside of this most notable heavy rain bullseye, other impressive area rain totals included 4.76 in Alma and 3.90 near Franklin. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing within South Central Nebraska: things got underway between 5-6 p.m. CDT as a large severe storm infiltrated southern Furnas County after initiating a bit earlier just west of the local area. During the same hour, another severe cell fired up slightly to its east over the Furnas/Harlan County line. Between 6-7 p.m. CDT these two storms merged over Harlan County before drifting slowly east across southern Franklin/Webster counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Meanwhile, during this same 7-9 p.m. CDT time frame but roughly 50-80 miles to the north-northeast, a separate area of scattered strong to severe activity briefly blossomed, primarily affecting parts of Buffalo, Sherman and Howard counties (and yielding a few hail reports) before fading away. Getting back to the original southern convection, the main concerns gradually transitioned from hail/wind to hydro/flooding between 9 p.m. and midnight CDT as a persistent, west-east oriented corridor of cell training focused along a line from Furnas through Webster counties (likely as a strengthening low level jet impinged upon the outflow/cold pool trailing from the earlier-evening storms). By midnight CDT this west-east corridor of training convection had thankfully lifted slightly north of its original position (more so along a line from Gosper through Kearney counties), ending the heavy rain threat for the night in the aforementioned places that had already been swamped with impressive amounts. Post-midnight, storms continued to percolate within portions of primarily Gosper/Phelps/Kearney/Webster/Nuckolls counties for a few to several more hours, but this activity was less intense and a bit more transient than the earlier round, keeping heavy rain and flooding concerns in check. By 5 a.m. CDT, the areal coverage of activity within southern local counties had waned considerably, with the last strong storm of the night affecting Nuckolls County before mostly-dissipating by sunrise. In the mid-upper levels, South Central Nebraska received a glancing blow of lift from a compact-but-potent shortwave trough swinging east-northeast from the Dakotas toward northern MN/southern Canada during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, the local area resided within a broad warm sector, slightly east-southeast of a weak cold front stalling out over western/north central Nebraska, and hundreds of miles south of a strong low pressure system (around 998 millibars) centered over southern Manitoba during the evening-overnight. Closer to home, the late afternoon initiation of robust storms near the Furnas County area was likely aided by modest moisture convergence focused slightly northeast of a secondary/weaker surface low (around 1004 millibars) along the CO/KS border. All in all, the mesoscale environment proved rather supportive of severe storms and transient supercell structures, with late afternoon parameters featuring 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE and around 40 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

Within the hardest-hit southern counties (mainly Furnas/Harlan/Franklin) there were several instances of not only severe-criteria wind/hail but also narrow swaths of very heavy rain and localized flash flooding...resulting from the highest official/measured short-fuse rain totals of the 2021 convective season within the 24-county local area. On the hail/wind side of things, a few of the more notable reports (all occurring between 5:30-11:30 p.m. CDT) included: golf ball size hail in rural northwestern Buffalo County; ping pong ball size stones near Wilsonville; several instances of estimated or measured gusts of 60-70 MPH within Furnas/Harlan counties (including a few downed trees in towns such as Alma/Orleans). However, for parts of primarily Furnas, Harlan, Franklin and Webster counties, this event's signature calling card was heavy rain and localized flooding. While the majority of those four counties received modest amounts of no more than 1-2 inches, significant training of storms dumped notably higher totals between 3-7+ in narrow swaths over the course of 6-8 hours. The most significant of these heavy rain bullseyes focused along/near the Highway 136 corridor between Orleans and Oxford, where 5-7+ was common, including an unofficial automated sensor that tallied 7.13 and nearby CoCoRaHS reports of 6.22 and 6.16. Although ground-truth reports of impactful flooding/flash flooding were sparse, a resident six miles north-northwest of Orleans confirmed that School Creek spilled out of its banks overnight, inundating a nearby gravel road for several hours and encroaching within 50 feet of his home. Despite this concentrated batch of very heavy rain falling directly onto the Republican River basin, there was no firm evidence that the Republican itself flooded before excess water flushed out into Harlan County Lake. Outside of this most notable heavy rain bullseye, other impressive area rain totals included 4.76 in Alma and 3.90 near Franklin. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing within South Central Nebraska: things got underway between 5-6 p.m. CDT as a large severe storm infiltrated southern Furnas County after initiating a bit earlier just west of the local area. During the same hour, another severe cell fired up slightly to its east over the Furnas/Harlan County line. Between 6-7 p.m. CDT these two storms merged over Harlan County before drifting slowly east across southern Franklin/Webster counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Meanwhile, during this same 7-9 p.m. CDT time frame but roughly 50-80 miles to the north-northeast, a separate area of scattered strong to severe activity briefly blossomed, primarily affecting parts of Buffalo, Sherman and Howard counties (and yielding a few hail reports) before fading away. Getting back to the original southern convection, the main concerns gradually transitioned from hail/wind to hydro/flooding between 9 p.m. and midnight CDT as a persistent, west-east oriented corridor of cell training focused along a line from Furnas through Webster counties (likely as a strengthening low level jet impinged upon the outflow/cold pool trailing from the earlier-evening storms). By midnight CDT this west-east corridor of training convection had thankfully lifted slightly north of its original position (more so along a line from Gosper through Kearney counties), ending the heavy rain threat for the night in the aforementioned places that had already been swamped with impressive amounts. Post-midnight, storms continued to percolate within portions of primarily Gosper/Phelps/Kearney/Webster/Nuckolls counties for a few to several more hours, but this activity was less intense and a bit more transient than the earlier round, keeping heavy rain and flooding concerns in check. By 5 a.m. CDT, the areal coverage of activity within southern local counties had waned considerably, with the last strong storm of the night affecting Nuckolls County before mostly-dissipating by sunrise. In the mid-upper levels, South Central Nebraska received a glancing blow of lift from a compact-but-potent shortwave trough swinging east-northeast from the Dakotas toward northern MN/southern Canada during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, the local area resided within a broad warm sector, slightly east-southeast of a weak cold front stalling out over western/north central Nebraska, and hundreds of miles south of a strong low pressure system (around 998 millibars) centered over southern Manitoba during the evening-overnight. Closer to home, the late afternoon initiation of robust storms near the Furnas County area was likely aided by modest moisture convergence focused slightly northeast of a secondary/weaker surface low (around 1004 millibars) along the CO/KS border. All in all, the mesoscale environment proved rather supportive of severe storms and transient supercell structures, with late afternoon parameters featuring 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE and around 40 knots of deep-layer wind shear."

The combination of blowing dust and wildfire smoke created near-apocalyptic scenes within parts of the area during the afternoon, firmly cementing this event in the history books. Above all else, the wildfires were the biggest story of the day locally, as three fairly large fires (and a few smaller ones) impacted primarily southern portions of Rooks/Osborne counties, cumulatively burning approximately 19,300 acres/30 square miles and sadly contributing to one fatality. The largest fire in southwestern Osborne County actually represented the northern fringes of the so-called Four Counties Fire that primarily impacted portions of Ellis/Russell counties just outside the local area (this fire as a whole consumed over 121,000 acres/190 square miles). Turning to the convection that preceded the big blazes, although North Central KS did not endure the blitz of quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes that states to the north-northeast did, the local area nonetheless served as the initiation zone of what was ultimately classified a serial derecho given that a nearly continuous swath of damaging winds extended hundreds of miles northeastward into southeast MN/western WI...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Within this six-county area, peak thunderstorm wind gusts registered up to 80 MPH and the more impactful and longer lasting non-thunderstorm gusts were commonly 65-80 MPH, with unofficial mesonets clocking incredible 95+ MPH gusts in a few spots. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries from the fierce winds, despite countless instances of damage primarily to trees, outbuildings and power lines/poles. Aside from the wildfires, the primary (and more widespread) issue caused by the relentless non-convective winds was a transient wall of dense blowing dust (mainly emanating from the eastern CO/western KS area), with ground-truth reports from observers near Damar and also Phillipsburg confirming visibility down to one-quarter mile or less for up to a few hours. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 45-55 MPH as temperatures soared to near-record/record levels in the low-70s F, accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F. Early in the afternoon a few local mesonet stations even recorded marginally-severe gusts around 60 MPH from the pre-convective southerlies. This set the stage for a quick round of severe wind-producing convection, as a small line of showers and initially-weak thunderstorms that first got going in northwest KS rapidly intensified and expanded in north-south extent as it entered the local area into Phillips/Rooks counties between 12:30-1 p.m. Over the next couple hours, this severe squall line raced across the remainder of the six-county area at roughly 60 MPH, already clearing eastern Jewell/Mitchell counties by 2:30 p.m. Along the way, area mesonets clocked several gusts into the 60-75 MPH range, with isolated 80 MPH gusts noted in southern Phillips and southeastern Rooks counties. Specific damage reports were limited but included: tree damage in Mankato and Downs; a large tree blown down and roof damage to outbuilding in far southeastern Osborne County. There were no local reports of severe-criteria hail.  ||Unfortunately, even with the convective line departing stage-right from the area, the worst weather of the day was yet to come as incredibly-strong (and generally westerly) non-convective winds surged across North Central KS behind a composite dryline/cold front, peaking in intensity primarily 2-7 p.m. During this time sustained speeds commonly averaged 35-50 MPH with frequent gusts of 65-80 MPH, with unofficial peak mesonet gusts highlighted by an incredible 97 MPH in far northern Smith County and 95 MPH in southeastern Rooks County. Although these remarkable winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convection, specific reports were actually quite limited beyond the aforementioned significantly-reduced visibility from blowing dust. No matter, the majority of attention quickly turned to the overall-most-significant events of the day in North Central KS...the rapidly spreading wildfires in Rooks/Osborne counties. Although fire ignition was largely attributed to downed power lines, and rapid fire spread was clearly driven by the phenomenal winds, area vegetation was also riper-than-usual for extreme fire growth thanks to a multiple-week stretch of very dry conditions. In fact, between Nov 1-Dec 15, the majority of the six-county area measured less than 0.15 of precipitation, making grasses/pastures very fire prone. Although more details regarding these Osborne/Rooks County wildfires can be found in their respective event narratives, several aspects of this event...including that they burned roughly 19,300 acres (cumulatively) within the two counties, killed hundreds of cattle, destroyed two homes and contributed to the death of an elderly man who inadvertently drove into the path of one of the fires...clearly cemented this as one of the worst wildfire events in North Central KS history. Although parts of the area continued to burn well into the night while blazes were gradually contained, thankfully west-northwest winds underwent a steady decrease through the evening, with severe-criteria gusts abating by around 7 p.m. and easing down to under 30 MPH by 9-10 p.m. ||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots lifted directly over North Central KS from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a very potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots before turning more westerly and intensifying to 60-80 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center tracked slightly north of the area across NE during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the region. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to around 500 J/kg. Although only modest instability by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing and more notable non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a nearly 10-millibar gradient transecting North Central KS from northeast-to-southwest at 5 p.m. (from around 990 mb at Hebron NE to around 1000 mb at Hill City KS). ||Closing with some comments regarding official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system, along with an unusually-concerning fire weather threat. A High Wind Watch was issued for North Central KS early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. Meanwhile, a Fire Weather Watch was issued early on the 14th (36 hours in advance) and upgraded to a Red Flag Warning that afternoon. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was that the area would also face the threat of severe convection, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west-southwest than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a late ramp-up of convective threat categories within North Central KS on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that kept any official severe risk altogether east of the local area, to the 1630Z outlook that at least shifted a sliver of Marginal (level 1) and Slight (level 2) categories westward into parts of (albeit not enough of) the area."

As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to around 500 J/kg. Although only modest instability by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing and more notable non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a nearly 10-millibar gradient transecting North Central KS from northeast-to-southwest at 5 p.m. (from around 990 mb at Hebron NE to around 1000 mb at Hill City KS). ||Closing with some comments regarding official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system, along with an unusually-concerning fire weather threat. A High Wind Watch was issued for North Central KS early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. Meanwhile, a Fire Weather Watch was issued early on the 14th (36 hours in advance) and upgraded to a Red Flag Warning that afternoon. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was that the area would also face the threat of severe convection, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west-southwest than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a late ramp-up of convective threat categories within North Central KS on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that kept any official severe risk altogether east of the local area, to the 1630Z outlook that at least shifted a sliver of Marginal (level 1) and Slight (level 2) categories westward into parts of (albeit not enough of) the area."

The combination of blowing dust and wildfire smoke created near-apocalyptic scenes within parts of the area during the afternoon, firmly cementing this event in the history books. Above all else, the wildfires were the biggest story of the day locally, as three fairly large fires (and a few smaller ones) impacted primarily southern portions of Rooks/Osborne counties, cumulatively burning approximately 19,300 acres/30 square miles and sadly contributing to one fatality. The largest fire in southwestern Osborne County actually represented the northern fringes of the so-called Four Counties Fire that primarily impacted portions of Ellis/Russell counties just outside the local area (this fire as a whole consumed over 121,000 acres/190 square miles). Turning to the convection that preceded the big blazes, although North Central KS did not endure the blitz of quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes that states to the north-northeast did, the local area nonetheless served as the initiation zone of what was ultimately classified a serial derecho given that a nearly continuous swath of damaging winds extended hundreds of miles northeastward into southeast MN/western WI...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Within this six-county area, peak thunderstorm wind gusts registered up to 80 MPH and the more impactful and longer lasting non-thunderstorm gusts were commonly 65-80 MPH, with unofficial mesonets clocking incredible 95+ MPH gusts in a few spots. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries from the fierce winds, despite countless instances of damage primarily to trees, outbuildings and power lines/poles. Aside from the wildfires, the primary (and more widespread) issue caused by the relentless non-convective winds was a transient wall of dense blowing dust (mainly emanating from the eastern CO/western KS area), with ground-truth reports from observers near Damar and also Phillipsburg confirming visibility down to one-quarter mile or less for up to a few hours. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 45-55 MPH as temperatures soared to near-record/record levels in the low-70s F, accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F. Early in the afternoon a few local mesonet stations even recorded marginally-severe gusts around 60 MPH from the pre-convective southerlies. This set the stage for a quick round of severe wind-producing convection, as a small line of showers and initially-weak thunderstorms that first got going in northwest KS rapidly intensified and expanded in north-south extent as it entered the local area into Phillips/Rooks counties between 12:30-1 p.m. Over the next couple hours, this severe squall line raced across the remainder of the six-county area at roughly 60 MPH, already clearing eastern Jewell/Mitchell counties by 2:30 p.m. Along the way, area mesonets clocked several gusts into the 60-75 MPH range, with isolated 80 MPH gusts noted in southern Phillips and southeastern Rooks counties. Specific damage reports were limited but included: tree damage in Mankato and Downs; a large tree blown down and roof damage to outbuilding in far southeastern Osborne County. There were no local reports of severe-criteria hail.  ||Unfortunately, even with the convective line departing stage-right from the area, the worst weather of the day was yet to come as incredibly-strong (and generally westerly) non-convective winds surged across North Central KS behind a composite dryline/cold front, peaking in intensity primarily 2-7 p.m. During this time sustained speeds commonly averaged 35-50 MPH with frequent gusts of 65-80 MPH, with unofficial peak mesonet gusts highlighted by an incredible 97 MPH in far northern Smith County and 95 MPH in southeastern Rooks County. Although these remarkable winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convection, specific reports were actually quite limited beyond the aforementioned significantly-reduced visibility from blowing dust. No matter, the majority of attention quickly turned to the overall-most-significant events of the day in North Central KS...the rapidly spreading wildfires in Rooks/Osborne counties. Although fire ignition was largely attributed to downed power lines, and rapid fire spread was clearly driven by the phenomenal winds, area vegetation was also riper-than-usual for extreme fire growth thanks to a multiple-week stretch of very dry conditions. In fact, between Nov 1-Dec 15, the majority of the six-county area measured less than 0.15 of precipitation, making grasses/pastures very fire prone. Although more details regarding these Osborne/Rooks County wildfires can be found in their respective event narratives, several aspects of this event...including that they burned roughly 19,300 acres (cumulatively) within the two counties, killed hundreds of cattle, destroyed two homes and contributed to the death of an elderly man who inadvertently drove into the path of one of the fires...clearly cemented this as one of the worst wildfire events in North Central KS history. Although parts of the area continued to burn well into the night while blazes were gradually contained, thankfully west-northwest winds underwent a steady decrease through the evening, with severe-criteria gusts abating by around 7 p.m. and easing down to under 30 MPH by 9-10 p.m. ||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system.

However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg.

As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out).

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning.

Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman.

In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties).

At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

It featured the first-ever December derecho observed anywhere in the United States and the first Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the NWS Storm Prediction Center in December for Iowa. Unofficially, it set the new single-day Iowa records for the most tornadoes and the most EF-2/F-2 or stronger tornadoes since 1950.  Finally, it will break the all-time December record high temperature for Iowa. ||Tornadoes: There were 63 confirmed tornadoes that occurred in Iowa, 21 of which were rated EF-2. Sixty three is unofficially the most tornadoes in Iowa in a single day with the previous being 35 tornadoes on August 31, 2014. Further, 21 EF-2 tornadoes is unofficially the most EF-2/F-2 or stronger tornadoes in a single day with the previous being 16 tornadoes on June 7, 1984. Prior to this event, a total of 5 tornadoes had occurred in Iowa in December since 1950 with all of them in southeastern Iowa.  | |Thunderstorm Wind: Numerous straight line wind gusts were also associated with these thunderstorms, some in excess of 80 mph.  During the event, nearly the entire state of Iowa was under a Severe Thunderstorm Warning at some point.  Audubon reported the highest gust in Iowa at 88 mph. This storm also met the criteria for a ���derecho'', which makes it the first derecho on record in the month of December anywhere in the United States.  Finally, we had an unofficial gust of 108 mph recorded by a mesonet station near Sheffield, Iowa associated with one of the tornadic circulations. ||Environmental Wind: After the line of storms had passed, numerous strong, non-thunderstorm wind gusts over 70 mph occurred overnight. The top three non-thunderstorm wind gusts were 83 mph in Decatur City, 81 mph in Marshalltown, and 80 mph in Johnston. The Des Moines International Airport recorded a 74 mph non-thunderstorm wind gust, which is the highest non-thunderstorm wind gust at this location since 1970.| |Temperatures: In addition to the severe weather and strong non-thunderstorm winds, the temperatures were remarkable and record setting. Numerous record daily highs were broken by many degrees. In addition and preliminarily, the all-time December record high temperature for Iowa of 74 degrees that was set in Thurman, IA on December 6, 1939 was broken with four sites reaching 75 degrees (Oskaloosa, Muscatine, Iowa City, and Ottumwa).||For detailed environmental analysis, including soundings, please view the various local NWS office event review pages: NWS Des Moines, NWS Sioux Falls, NWS Omaha, NWS Wichita, NWS Pueblo, NWS Twin Cities, NWS Quad Cities, NWS Hastings, NWS La Crosse, NWS Green Bay, or NWS Milwaukee."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast.

And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk.

However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford.

However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman.

The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

One hangar door was ripped off which collided it with another hangar door. Four other hangar doors were damaged. Two hangars suffered roof damage, and many bushes were ripped from the ground and strewn across the runway.

Damages are a rough estimate.","An abnormally strong storm system more typical of spring rather than early winter strengthened over the western United States early in the week of December 13, 2021. The defining characteristic for this system was the potent and dangerous upper-level jet associated with it as winds were well over 100 knots. As this system continued to deepen as it dived into the southwestern United States, these winds mixed down to the surface, resulting in a widespread historic windstorm for much of northern and central New Mexico on December 15, 2021. Its associated Pacific cold front arrived into western New Mexico early in the morning on the 15th, and wind speeds rapidly increased to over 60 mph at locations such as Gallup and Farmington. The rain and snow located along this cold front organized into a snow squall as it marched through western New Mexico and into the Rio Grande Valley. This resulted in blowing snow and reduced visibility along roadways such as Interstate 40 near Gallup. Several vehicle accidents were reported along Interstate 40 in McKinley County due to poor travel conditions which forced the closure of the major highway for a few hours during the morning. Lightning was even associated with this squall line which result in a period of thundersnow for the Farmington area with wind gusts in excess of 60 mph. As this storm system moved through the state during the afternoon hours, wind speeds continued to increase with the highest gusts recorded along and east of the central mountain chain due to downsloping winds. The highest gust during this event was 103 mph at Taos Ski Valley which sustained significant tree damage. Other high winds were generally 70 to 90 mph across the eastern plains. Numerous damage reports were received areawide, including downed trees and power lines, damage to mobile homes and other structures, and numerous traffic accidents.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties).

The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281."

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States.
